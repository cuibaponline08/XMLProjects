        <description>In over sixty years I accumulated a vast library of classic motorcycle literature, but now, approaching 80, I must downsize and offer my treasures to those noble souls dedicated to rebuilding and riding our splendid older machines. This original Triumph publication, with its dark orange cover, has over 100 pages of gen for post-war rigid and sprung hub models 5T, T100, TR5 &amp; 6T. It contains 35 detailed line drawings, including exploded views, fault finding charts, instructions for fitting a sidecar, conversion to racing trim &amp; a two-page technical data chart. Come and see the original item, you will not be disappointed. . It will be a prized asset to accompany your rebuilt, or possibly, original Speed Twin, Thunderbird or their sporty derivatives. . What is more, the manual is in really splendid, almost mint, condition, with no oily fingermarks, the only blemish being a small ink stain on the spine. Not bad for a 65 year-old. Price includes First Class post.</description>

        <description>HONDA. XR 70RV. RARE 1997 ONLY MODEL. ONE OWNER. LIGHT USE. ALWAYS STORED INDOORS, SAFE AND DRY. STARTS VERY EASILY FROM COLD, JUST A FEW KICKS. STARTS EVERY KICK WHEN WARMED UP. IDLES SMOOTHLY WITH NICE DEEP/LOW FREQUENCY TONE FROM THE ORIGINAL EXHAUST. REVS SMOOTHLY AND STRONGLY. RIDES GREAT, PLENTY OF TORQUE. STOPS GREAT. HANDLES GREAT. VERY COMFORTABLE. RECENT RENTHAL 7 INCH BAR PAD. COLUR - WHITE. ENGINE - HONDA, FLAT, 72CC 4-STROKE, SINGLE CYLINDER, 2 VALVES. GEARBOX - 3 SPEED SEMI-AUTOMATIC, CENTRIFUGAL CLUTCH. FRAME NUMBER: JH2DE02A0VK000978. ENGINE NUMBER: DE02E - 5006856. FRONT SPROCKET - STANDARD 16 TOOTH. REAR SPROCKET - STANDARD 36 TOOTH. MOTORCYCLE STYLE - OFF ROAD. FRONT TYRE = CHENG SHIN, 14" VGCC. REAR TYRE = CHENG SHIN, 12" VGCC. FRONT WHEEL = POLISHED CHROME, SPOKED, 14" VGCC. REAR WHEEL = POLISHED CHROME, SPOKED, 12" VGCC. IT WILL SUIT AGES 6 TO ADULT UP TO 15 STONE NO PROBLEM APPROX. THE ORIGINAL HAND GRIPS HAVE SEEN BETTER DAYS BUT WORK FINE AND SHOULD LAST A LONG TIME. THE SWINGARM HAS A FEW LIGHT SPECS OF RUST BUT NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE PLASTICS HAVE A FEW LIGHT SCUFFS HERE AND THERE. ALL OF THE GRAPHICS, DECALS AND STICKERS ARE ORIGINAL. IT EVEN STILL HAS THE TINY SQUARE CLEAR STICKER WITH A HONDA LOGO ON IT ON THE FUEL TANK, WHICH ARE A RARE SIGHTING THESE DAYS. I HAVE CHANGED THE SPARK PLUG, OIL AND AIR FILTER EVERY YEAR WITHOUT FAIL. MANY PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE SHOWED GREAT INTEREST IN THIS XR OVER THE YEARS. IT BRINGS A SMILE TO EVERYONES FACE. MANY HAVE EVEN ASKED TO BUY IT. BUT ONLY A FEW LUCKY ONES HAVE TOUCHED IT OR HAD A LITTLE GO ON IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON A CHEAP CHINESE MOTORBIKE. THEY ARE LIKE DISPOSABLE LIGHTERS. MANY MODERN CLASSIC OFFROAD MOTORBIKES LIKE THE YAMAHA PW80 OR KAWASAKI KX60 AND XR'S FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN OWNED OR STOLEN BY MORONS WHO ABSOLUTELY ABUSE THEM IN EVERY WAY. THIS HONEST HONDA OF MINE, ISN'T IN SHOWROOM CONDITION BUT HAS BEEN STORED CAREFULL AND USED SENSIBLY NOW AND AGAIN. IF LOOKED AFTER CORRECTLY, IT WILL LAST FOR A VERY LONG TIME. OEM AND AFTERMARKET PARTS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE. ACTUAL PICTURES OF MY XR. TO VIEWERS HOPING FOR SOME SPARE PARTS - SORRY BUT I WILL NOT STRIP IT. I WILL BE VERY SAD TO SEE THIS GO. WHAT A GREAT LITTLE MOTORCYCLE. THE CASH AND SPACE WILL HELP ME TO FINSH AN IMPORTANT PROJECT. SENSIBLE OFFERS ONLY PLEASE, I OWN, WORK ON AND DRIVE MANY VEHICLES FOR WORK AND MY HOBBY. YOU ONLY SEE AN XR70R FOR SALE NOW AND AGAIN. MOST SEEM TO BE 1998 OR 1999 MODELS WHICH ARE GREAT TOO BUT NOT AS RARE OR AS SOUGHT AFTER ETC AS THIS 1997 MODEL. A MORE COMMON 1998 OR 1999 MODEL HAS JUST SOLD ON EBAY FOR £411.00. IT LOOKED OLD, TIRED AND ABUSED. THE DESCRIPTION WAS POOR. THE SELLER WAS ARROGANT. THERE WAS NO INFORMATION FROM SELLER AT ALL. MY XR IS WORTH THE EXTRA. FREE WIRRAL DELIVERY ONLY OR COLLECTION. WILL FIT IN ALMOST ANY CAR IF DONE RIGHT. CASH ONLY. BE QUICK. IT WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR LONG. I AM A TRUSTWORTHY PRELOVED AND EBAY MEMBER OF MANY YEARS. I HAVE 100% POSITIVE FEEDBACK. THANKS.</description>

        <description>Good runner, mechanically sound with some cosmetic defects photographs available. Was ridden daily until end of 2014 when I moved to the south of England and my job role changed. I have owned it for 10 years and have never had and mechanical difficulties. Replacement of chain and sprocket before moving to Bristol and since then sadly it has not been ridden very often at all, though regularly cleaned and oiled. It has recently been brought to my attention that the speed is not functioning. I think this could be due to the cable as it appears kinked. This bike has had regular services during the years however unfortunately I misplaced the service book until my move so there is no official record of these. Due to minimal opportunities to ride over the past 12 months and with summer round the corner I have regrettably come to the decision that it is time for this bike to find a new home. With Tax, MOT and insurance all due it is sady time we part. Please feel free to come and view this bike or phone me to ask further questions</description>

        <description>A spare project bike. This bike has a V5 in my name :) The motor is in a box but looks ok. I have done nothing with it except to look and see the tank is very clean inside. What you see is what there is. Look at my other listing for my XL200R that has a 125 Paris Dakar (Elec start) motor in it that could be put in here. Collect Grantham. Cash only. Thanks</description>

        <description>Honda XL200R spares or repair. This bike has a 125cc Paris Dakar (Electric start) motor in it. Motor turns over on button but have not tried to start. Going to need some time working on it but a nice base. I also have an XL125R listed that needs a motor, this one could slot in for an easy road legal bike as that has a V5.... The 200 does NOT have a V5 so you would have to apply for that. What you see in the photos is what you get, photos takes yesterday not 10 years ago :) Collect Grantham, Cash only.

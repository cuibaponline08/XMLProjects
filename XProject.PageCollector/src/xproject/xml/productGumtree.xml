        <description>1991 Ducati 750 Paso, low miles of just 22990, 12 months MOT. Not used for a few years so just serviced inc belts. In very nice condition for its age with just a few minor marks to the paint. It starts and rides very well but has a few very minor niggles which would be an easy fix. The starter solenoid sticks sometimes but never fails to start. There is a crack in the perspex speedo cover and it could do with a new front indicator lens. I would consider any bike as a px, new or old, big or small, just email with full details. I can deliver up to 100 miles from Harrogate North Yorkshire for 70p per mile one way. Any questions, call, text or email Steve 07909568945</description>

        <description>1999 Kawasaki ZX9R C2, 25500 miles, MOT until February 2017. In pretty good condition for its age, few minor scuffs n scrapes but not too bad. Good tyres, brakes, chain etc, starts and can be ridden. The bike jumps out of 2nd/3rd under load, this is a common zx9 fault. The gears will need replaceing or repair, this should cost about £150 and a days work to drop the motor out and fix the gears. Its not too difficult if you dont mind getting your hands dirty. Will also need a battery very soon. Don't have time to fix so selling as seen. This could be a cheap superbike for someone. I can deliver up to 100 miles from Harrogate North Yorkshire for 70p per mile one way. I would consider any bike as a px but no projects or rubbish please, cash either way. Any questions, call, text or email Steve 07909568945</description>

        <description>Kymco City Agility 125cc (learner legal) which is about 1 year old and has done 2000 miles. First service maintenance carried out at 1000km in mid May 2015. Has service record book, paperwork and drivers manual kept. Selling as I no longer use the bike for commuting. Originally purchased as it has 100 miles per gallon fuel consumption and it has 16" wheels which are larger than most scooters. This ensures that you feel bumps in the road less than on a traditional machine. It weighs 120kg which means that it's easy to manoeuvre and park. Kick start works which I've struggled to find with previous scooters that I've owned. The MOT is valid for another two years. Road tax is £17 a year.</description>

        <description>Having just got my Harley out the garage after being in there all winter I have decided to sell. It is a 2003 Sportster 1200 C. Its generally in good condition excluding a few minor things which I would change if keeping it. These will be detailed at the bottom of the advert. It comes with many after market parts to give it the more bobber/brat Harley look despite it being pretty clean and useable. In my ownership I have done the following: Bought a new bobber style rear mudguard with lights etc. It was from a Harley custom place in Germany, I had it sprayed to match and fitted it around Christmas time ( I also still have the original with the light etc should you wish to standardize it) – this mod cost a total of around £200 including the light and spray. It has a side mounted number plate with number plate lights to match the look. - quite a cheap mod. Just after I put it away for storage I had the rear wheel stripped completely, powder coated matte black, then had brand new wheel bearings fitted professionally (they're pressed bearings so very tricky and delicate) - this came to around a total of £200+. I didn’t like the bars it had when I bought it so I fitted ape hangers for that ‘look’ around £65. Im afraid it doesn’t come with the badlander seat shown in the pictures as I was just borrowing it to see if I wanted one. It will come with the original Harley Davidsnon seat which still looks good but with the new mudguard I would consider getting a lower profile seat or a single seat. The new black front indicators are not to everyone’s taste, however they do the job and I do have the originals should you wish to change (very easy clip on clip off). Last weekend I put new oil in her and fitted a new filter, I also changed primary drive oil so it’s serviced ready for the new owner. Some minor points I will make: One exhaust slip on (screaming eagle ones – which you can get cheap enough) has some slight scrapes where it had been stored up against a wall – it will come with another set of slash cut leaf blower type exhausts. After getting it out last weekend the speedo is being temperamental… it lights up shows the mileage and everything else but the needle tries to move when you pull away but doesn’t seem to have the guts to move (this was working fine in September when I put her away). I’ve read up on it and the sensor may need a clean, ill show you where it is I just haven’t got around to it. Runs beautifully, selects each gear faultlessly, sounds as a Harley should! AMAZING. Necessaries: Mot until sept/oct. Good tyres Good battery Good brake pads Good belt Some cosmetic wear and tear as expected for age of bike Comes with a some other spare parts too.</description>

        <description>Rf900r 30k miles m.o.t end of this month. 2 keys ignition and tank and 1 for seat. Comes with a cowel. Has Wavey Discs, braided brake lines, New tyres, New chain and sprockets. I get loads of compliments on how fast this bike is and how good it looks. It does need a little more work to your own style. I have no Speedo clock on this bike I liked the naked style. Needs left fork seal. Possibly brakes but they are acceptable. Can come with another engine and most of the old rf plastics i.e headlight fairing sides. Also clocks. Selling because I have a bike lined up already. £1400 o.n.o Willing to bargain. I work days only free Sunday (today) and Thursday but can do evenning. Although I use this bike for daily use to Bridgend and back (work).</description>

        <description>Y Reg first registered in the UK in 2005 (Bought new in Germany). MOT with no advisories 14/4/2017 Security features: Honda HiSS immobilizer, Honda Alarm with 2 key fobs and original Honda U-lock under the seat &amp; integrated helmet lock. Full MOT history. Honda heated grips and genuine topbox with 3 Honda pannier inserts. Owners manual &amp; Haynes manual Motad stainless steel exhaust. Recent spark plugs, air filter, oil filter, oil and new cooling system cover. Michelin Pilot tyres fitted last year (1000 miles ago). Starts first time, every time. Great on fuel. Reliable shaft drive tourer. New battery last year. 12V/5V Aux socket. 2 keys. V 5 present. Wind deflectors. 15 years old bike so has plenty marks on her. Previous owner from Highlands so has some surface rust at places. Needs to be seen- I would say it looks better on the pictures. Could be easily sorted or ride as it is. Reflected in the asking price. Open to reasonable offers once the bike has been seen.</description>

        <description>This is my mates abs mint RF600 Its had the swingarm and rear footrests newly powder-coated The fork legs, top bracket and wheels have been stripped, then mirror polished. It has had a new link pipe and silencer fitted - sound lovely! It has only covered just under 16000 miles, which is nothing for the year. These are becoming very collectable, as they produce more power (100 bhp) than the 600 bandit (78 bhp) It will have a years M.O.T on it for buyer. You can reach my mate via email or just give me a ring on the number on the advert....Cheers ......No Numpties, Dreamers or Scammers please.....</description>

        <description>Honda cbr600rr 2003 Bike is in stunning condition had it professionally painted in HM plant Isle of Man TT John Mcguinnes replica. The wheels have been painted in orange with a outer black bead. The bike has a scorpion exhaust fitted which sounds great. I had a full service done in the summer last year at Finns motorcycles in Redhill, which included front discs and pads along with brand new Dunlop tyres and brand new battery. I have all paper work for this. The body work and wheels were also done last summer which cost me £1500 which I also have receipts for. Since having the service and Brand new Dunlop tyers fitted and bodywork done the bike has barely covered 200 miles. In total I have spent over £3000 and have the receipts of proof. I'm only selling due to having a work related accident and unable to ride it anymore which I'm gutted about. I'm in no rush to sell so please don't bother with any stupid offers. Please no international buyers or scammers or dreamers. Cash on Collection only. No test rides unless the cash is in my hand. Any questions please ask or call 07415034928 £3650 ONO CROYDON SURREY</description>

        <description>I have owned this bike from new and used it only for commuting to and from work. Lots of storage space and very comfortable to ride. I had a puncture last week so the rear tyre had to be replaced so it has a brand new Michelin tyre in the back. Both front and rear break pads are in good condition. The bike has something on the engine that causes the engine to randomly stall when idle, I'm not sure what the issue is but this has started happening around 3 months ago. I use the bike everyday to go to work and this hasn't stopped me. A red light flashes on the dash probably because of that. I had one small accident with it and there are a few signs of that around the bike. Also one of the 2 rear light bulbs need changing. Apart from that the bikes works just fine. Comes with the 2 original keys. Please email with any questions you may have and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. I'm home most evenings for viewings in SW16 (Norbury). £1000 ONO Thanks for looking.</description>

        <description>Honda CBF 125, a great little bike that has been looked after. These bikes are perfect for commuting, learning/CBT or simply to save money on motoring costs. This bike does an average 95 mpg so it's very cost effective to run and only £17 to tax per year! Bike is complete with V5, Honda owners manual, clear HPI report. It now has 12 months MOT on it an a brand new rear Avon tyre so its good to go. Its also fitted with a remote alarm too. does have a slight crack on right hand panel but doesn't affect the bike and isn't really that noticeable. A very reliable, quality built bike that will please its new owner. Why waste your money on a cheap and nasty Chinese import bike, its Honda so you know it will be a quality, reliable bike. If you're not local I can give arrange to have the bike delivered if you need using a local motorbike delivery service(at your cost) Viewing is welcome during day (day is preferred) or eve at Wirral CH62 Any questions please call 07583133584 Please note silly low offers will not get a reply - Genuine interest only please NO TRADERS PLEASE</description>

        <description>I bought this bike new 2 years ago from a Honda dealer - registered 2014. Full Service History by Honda - 500 mile service, 2500 mile service &amp; 5000 mile service all complete by Honda. This bike has only done 4315 miles but I have had the 5000 mile service done ready for the new owner, only done last week. Additional to this I have changed the oil myself every 1000 miles in between Honda services. Broken in gently for the first 500 miles and not thrashed like most are when bought new. MOT due 2017 Very cheap to tax - £17 Over 100 MPG and just over £10 to fill it up for hundreds of miles use. I have every single receipt for this bike including original documents. It has been immaculately cared for. The only blemish on the bike is shown on the picture of the exhaust. This sale includes R&amp;G bike cover, Xena lock and chain (heavy duty) &amp; Roxter lock for those short journeys. All bike and locks come with spare keys. You wont find a better cared for bike than this 2nd hand. In perfect working order - first to see will buy. Please no time wasters, viewings are more than welcome but anybody wanting to test will need to have full payment ready. Thanks for viewing</description>

        <description>Hi there, Here i have my much loved 1986 Japanese import GSXR400RR but unfortunately due to working and funds, i do not have the time to ride her or give her the affection she deserves so she sits in my garage. I have the full V5 in my name and some service history and mots, the bike was also set up by dyno jet a few years back. The bike is in all round good condition, hasn't been crashed and the wheels have been recently powered coated. Comes with an aftermarket viper can which sounds great. Due to how much i work i haven't been able to put her on the road and the mot has expired. She has 33000km on the clock and runs, rides and stops well. Tyres have plenty of life and chain and sprockets are nearly new and i do have some service history and old mot's. £950 ovno Feel free to ask me anything about the bike on 07902963288.</description>

        <description>Reluctantly selling my 2006 Honda Lead: the most reliable vehicle I've ever owned. I've used it for four years for commuting and for trips to town or to the beach. Unfortunately, I don't use it enough to justify keeping it, nor do I have the space. Brand new spark plug and filter, MOT to July, brand new back tyre, 2 keys, reliable and economical, lights and indicators working as they should although the left indicator can be temperamental. Some fading on the panels as the pictures show and bits of rust which have been there since I bought it and have never affected the MOTs. The mileometer appears to have stopped working but it's hardly been used in the past year and the old MOTs will show it. The front tyre will probably need replacing at the next MOT. Just being honest. Need the space now or I wouldn't sell it! A solid little Honda. £350 ono</description>

        <description>R1 version of the drifter with bigger tank and all the chrome. This one is standard and unmolested apart from the addition of expensive accessories as shown in the pictures. This is one stunning bike. Great original condition with new tyres and recent MOT. Its a powerful big V-twin but delivers great fuel economy of 55-60 mpg. Very easy to maintain as valves are hydraulic and self adjusting. Change the oil every 3000 miles and the bike could reach over 250,000 miles as recorded in the USA. The design is a blatant copy of the old 1940 Indian chief and very retro. Possible future classic? Reduced by 500 for quick sale.</description>

        <description>This bike belongs to my father who bought it to bring back memories of his youth, unfortunately it didn't get used and so it's been sitting in a garage for the best part of 14 years with only 106 miles on the clock!!!! It still runs great with good breaks and tyres. It has a trickle charger for the battery which will be sold with it. The aluminium handlebar has signs of corrosion but it's limited and that's the only sign of it's age.</description>

        <description>Here is my Aprilia RS125, it has MOT until July, has done 10,000 miles, has a crack in the panel due to previous owner dropping the bike whilst idle, I have some history with the bike, only selling due to me and my partner now have a newborn and we will be sharing a car, I have only used this bike to drive to work and back so have used it less than 10 times, sad to see it go. I'm asking for 1600ono feel free to contact me and ask any questions on 07796284455</description>

        <description>My aspencade first reg in uk 1996 declared manufacturd in us 1984 .good for age runs well rare bike low miles. Garaged for last couple of years .I bought it to trike but too good to chop to bits .needs an enthusiast to give it some TLC. needs a battery and near side mirror over all it is a good honest bike sorry no mot as I don't have bike licence cannot get it to mot station. I have been told it is a rare bike as it was oñley made for a couple of years it has digital speedo and tacho can switch from miles to kph it is original not been messed around with .re advertised due to time wasters this bike is not said to be immaculate but for its age quite good will make the right person a nice bike .thanks for taking time to read this</description>

        <description>selling our bullet proof cg 125 . as a voluntary training school we have owned this bike from new . it has done many cbt,s so its never been thrashed or mistreated and maintained very well . yes its been laid down quite a few times in the training area . has a scuff here and there . in my opinion its better than the new cg as it has electric and kick start / so no worries if battery is low . 12 months mot (passed with flying colours) . with just 8100 miles. TYRES are in great condition .BRAKES have loads left . runs smooth ... its ready to ride .. ive not seen anything on the internet for sale like this bike . so I'm asking for a realistic PRICE of only £800</description>

        <description>Honda fireblade for sale Exceptional performance and in great condition MOT 8 months remaining Conti motion 2 tyres with minimal use New grips recently and mirrors Epc Kevlar clutch Stubby cnc levers Mileage is in km Steering damper Single seat cowl Carbon fibre front and rear mudguards (Harris) Titanium silencer Smoked front screen Frame protective sliders K&amp;N Perfectly powder coated wheels Cbr bar ends Well maintained and serviced by myself I have owned this bike for three years where it has started every time and run perfectly, it handles superb and this model has a great write up, seem to be getting fewer on the roads. The only one issue is it requires 4th dog gear to be changed, it has developed an issue with fourth and jumps out at high rpm, all other gears work correctly and accelerates perfect. Any questions please ask, defective gear reflected in price. I do not have the time to rectify this problem Reason for sale is we require a camper van. Honda says The CBR954RR produces 154 horsepower at 11,250 rpm and 74.6 lb./ft. of torque at 9,000 rpm with a 12,150-rpm rev limiter. Weight-saving measures reduce the overall dry weight to 168 kilograms (370 pounds), resulting in a class-leading power-to-weight ratio. 954cc liquid-cooled inline four-cylinder engine features a 1.0mm bore increase to 75mm and an increase in compression ratio to 11.5:1 for stronger low-end and mid-range engine response. Crankshaft and engine cases are refined with the assistance of computer-aided design (CAD) to minimize friction and reduce weight nearly 170 grams (6 ounces) for optimum performance and long engine life. Each forged piston is lightened 6 percent and weighs only 170 grams (6 ounces). Additional weight is pared from the four piston pins, further reducing total reciprocating weight to permit faster engine-revving, decrease unpleasant vibration and minimize engine stress associated with the increased displacement. An oil spray is directed toward the undersides of the pistons to ensure the bigger and lighter pistons remain cool, enhancing power and contributing to long engine life. Single exhaust valve springs replace double springs to reduce friction, reduce unsprung valve train weight by a total of 71 grams (2.5 ounces) and permit the engine to rev more quickly. · Fuel injector throttle bodies are increased in diameter from 40mm to 42mm. Each new electronic fuel injector has 12 laser-drilled jet holes for finer fuel atomization, resulting in smoother, more responsive throttle performance and faster, more efficient combustion for stronger power output. Advanced programmed fuel injection (PGM-FI) features a sophisticated throttle sensor and sophisticated fuel injection mapping to produce smooth and linear throttle response, responding precisely to fine throttle adjustments. Second-generation PGM-FI electronic control unit (ECU) featuring a larger memory and newly programmed control maps achieves faster processing speeds than the ECU it replaces. · Redesigned, lighter-weight fuel tank hose is easily repositioned for servicing. · Higher-capacity radiator and modified internal cooling paths improve cooling efficiency by 5 percent for stable operating temperatures under a wide range of riding conditions. New starter motor with neodium magnets is 397 grams (14 ounces) lighter than the previous design. New ultra-lightweight titanium muffler further reduces overall exhaust system weight by 312 grams (11 ounces), while the natural dark finish and milled aluminum end-caps contribute to the HRC(r) works-type appearance. Redesigned transmission gear engagement dogs result in a smoother, more positive shifting feel. Modifications to the steering head casting thickness increase torsional rigidity 10 percent for even sharper handling. Lighter, redesigned rear castings feature repositioned frame rail mounts for the slimmer seat rail. New tapered-roller steering head bearings provide an even more precise steering feel. All-new swingarm showcases HRC's latest racing technology with a huge right-side box-section pressed form coupled to a new reinforced left-side extrusion. Despite its larger size, the new swingarm's thinner walls achieve a remarkable 261 gram (9.2-ounce) weight reduction over the swingarm it replaces. D-shape swingarm casting reaching under the swingarm pivot is refined with CAD to provide variable casting thicknesses to further enhance torsional rigidity. Rear shock absorber's spring weight is reduced by a remarkable 198 grams (7 ounces). Brake calipers (two front, one rear) feature Nimuflon(tm)-coated steel pistons and Teflon-coated rollback seals to enhance braking feel under repeated hard use. Brake fluid system pressure is increased 10 percent, resulting in even better braking feel and performance. New lightweight wheels feature more compact hubs and narrower hollow-section spokes, trimming off nearly 170 grams (6 ounces) of unsprung weight from each wheel for even better handling. All-new distinctive bodywork features a lower, more sharply angled and aggressively designed front cowl and a lighter, slimmer seat cowl. A new hugger rear fender closely follows the curve of the rear tire. A new, narrow-eye multi-reflector headlight has a single, central H7 low/high beam surrounded by two additional H7 high beams to brilliantly illuminate the night roadway. Upper fuel tank dimensions are reduced 10mm in height and length to move the rider closer to the steering head for more responsive control and greater rider maneuverability. The upper fuel tank profile flows smoothly into the seat for a clean and integrated look while the fuel tank is expanded downward between the frame rails to maintain effective volume and contribute to mass centralization. New aluminum footpeg brackets are stronger and nearly 56 grams (2 ounces) lighter than the steel pieces they replace. LED-type taillight provides brilliant illumination and exceptionally long life.</description>

        <description>Suzuki Burgman 400 For sale as spares or repairs. It was running absolute fine up until 3 days ago and just lost power and died on me. On the road side I checked the HT lead and spark plug. But these seem fine so no idea what's wrong with it. I haven't the time to investigate further so selling as a non runner. Maybe a simple fix but I really don't know. Cosmetically it is well used and I removed the front wind shield as the wind blew it off its stand and cracked it. I used it daily for commuting to work and back and it never missed a beat up until a few days back. Perhaps it can be of use to someone who has the time to get back on the road for a cheap runaround. Tyres still have lots of life ( new continental on the back) Still approx 6 months MOT Will need to be picked up on trailer or van obviously. £150 Ono If interested please phone or text Dave on 07989222354</description>

        <description>Honda CB200 Overall nice original condition. Great restoration project. On SORN, no MOT, but starts sounds and looks nice I think! Good old retro/vintage! Has original paper air filters and air boxes - quite common to be replaced by K&amp;Ns. New universal exhausts sound/look nice, new battery, new rear tube, Avon rear tyre and tape yet to go on. Needs fettling; carbs need setting up, small tear taped up on seat, pitting chrome, front brake needs overhaul/repair - doesnt do anything! Apparently these are common to upgrade with bigger CB front wheels. Strong engine, these can be tuned up with CB/CD parts. Would make a cheap classic racer? Do also have a spare frame with reg plate if you want to delug that and keep this frame orig. (would throw this in!). Would take near offers as need money for other project! Thanks for reading this far!</description>

Top speed, 55mph. Service history, spare keys, manuals, helmet, gloves and Buffalo jacket all included in the sale price. Only selling as I've just passed my car test. Bike will need MOT soon I haven't got time with work and college to run it in to get one. Gutted to be selling this, but I hope the next owner enjoys it as much as I did. Any questions text me.</description>

        <description>Honda VFR 800 For sale, 2014, Honda VFR 800. Black in colour, 2 owners from new with me being the 2nd. I bought the bike with 6910 miles on the clock from Balderstone BMW in Peterborough and it now has 9962. The bike is in very good condition and i have the single seat hump that goes with the bike, but i don't think it has been on the bike. Bike has heated grips and traction control, i have fitted a fender extender on the front mudguard and also an R &amp; G radiator cover. MOT is not due until 01/09/2017. The only reason i am selling is that i am buying another bike and i have a part exchange price from the dealer. In a dealers this bike would be £7995 plus. If you are interested in a VFR then you can save some money on dealers price!!! As stated i have a dealers part ex price, so please no silly offers, dreamers or scammers. Bike does not leave me until cash in hand or funds cleared in account. Test rides available as long as i have full cash price in my hand and you have insurance, you bin it, you buy it!!!. Sorry about the above, but serious buyers will understand.</description>

        <description>I love this bike. Very much don't want to sell but I no longer commute so I can no longer get away with that excuse. Cheap to run and fun to ride. This bike has made me fall in love with motorcycling. Price reflects the need for new back tyre and that it could probably do with some oil on the chain and tightening up. Also the slightly higher than average mileage (due to commuting). Covered in car port for winter (when not ridden). Runs fine... more than that, runs fun. , 2 Owners, Part service history, Next MOT due on 29/09/2016, Electric start</description>

        <description>Honda ST1100 Pan European. R reg, 1997. In Wineberry red. Only 20631 miles, and apart from a small crack in the right hand mirror cover (shown) is in absolutely brilliant condition. There's very little sign of wear on the footrest/gearchange rubbers, the levers, the handlebar switches, or any other controls. The brake discs look like they've almost never been used. I've included a picture of the underside/centre stand to try to give some idea of how clean the whole bike really is. Any inspections are welcome. Comes with. 12 Months Mot. Hardly worn, matching pair of Bridgestone Battlax BT023's Two screens, standard height and extra tall for touring. Wind deflectors on the mirrors and fairing sides. Front and rear mudguard extenders. Datatagged. Haynes (service/repair) and Honda (owners) manuals. Some sevice history. Previous MOTs going back to 2005. Original colour matched panniers, and aftermarket quick release top box. All with keys, and very clean inside and out. Brand new battery fitted 26/2/2016. This is genuinely good clean bike, at a very reasonable price.</description>

        <description>Quite a rare bike, same engine as the cagiva Mito. Very fast bike, starts 1st time and sounds great with the arrow exhaust. I bought it a few years ago with the intention of getting my bike licence but this never happened. Recently had a new battery fitted but the bike has no mot as its been off the road for around 5 years, I've had to reapply for the log book but it should be here soon. These bikes are going for over £1000 on eBay so the price is reflected without the mot but this does not mean I'm taking any less than the asking price so don't waste your time asking.</description>

        <description>Selling on behalf of my son, his Honda nes125 on a 51 plate. This has had a complete engine rebuild and a top end rebore and over sized piston fitted due to a seize up. (this is prob closer to a 135) It has as you can see from the photo's, had a custome paint job as it was silver. There were only a couple of minor advisories on the mot which the bike passed today 16/04/2016, these are, a couple of fairing screws missing, the front tyre getting close to legal limit and very minor, barely visable misting on one of the front forks, coming from a seal. It has done aprox 24k but only just over 600 miles from total engine rebuild. This bike had had hundreds of £££'s spent on it. This is a very quick reliable bike which has also had a brand new battery fitted on it and will top out close to 70mph. ONLY REASON FOR SALE IS.. My son is looking to buy a Supermoto geared 125cc bike. He is looking for £750ono. If anyone wants the front tyre done, an extra £50 plus fitting will be added to the purchase price and if they also want to fork seal done, extra on top will again be charged. NO TIMEWASTERS OR TYRE KICKERS PLEASE</description>

        <description>Panniers and rack for 650 v strom. I just sold my 2004 650 v stro and the new owner didnt want these. As far as i know they should fit all 650 models from 2004 to 2011. They might also fit the 1000cc models but i am not sure. I dont know who the manufacturer is and there is no key for the locks hence the bargain price. Located near snaith east yorkshire, cash on collection preferred. Tel 07764 627965. I will not answer text messages</description>

        <description>Here is my 2006 Aprilia RSV100 R, in excellent condition for the year. I have recently fitted a new uprated 14 amp battery, Ricks Stator, new regulator, upgraded solenoid, Renthal sprocket. The tyres are in good condition with plenty of tread on both. (Michelin Pilot Road) fair bit of service receipt history and old MOT's (Current MOT Expires- 29.01.17) Short brake&amp;clutch levers, comes with standard exhaust fitted but I do have a pair of stainless stubby race cans with removable baffles that will go with the bike and are loud on this brilliant V2. Always starts, mechanically and electrically sound. Fitted with a Datatool 4 C1 Red Alarm system. 2 keys and 3 alarm fobs. A few small marks here and there, but all consistent with the age. This has been an excellent bike being my first V-Twin. I am only selling because I have brought an R1 and can't keep both. Bike is in Dover, Kent. Feel free to ask any questions.

        <description>Road registered Yamaha raptor 660 Bought as a full rolling shell (everything apart from the engine) as a project with intentions of swapping the standard engine for a bike engine. Bought a donar bike. Kawasaki zzr600 so at the moment the frame has been modified an the engine is in and has been running. Would make a good project for anyone that want to finish or simply just get a new frame and start from scratch everything is there apart from the standard fuel tank. Fuel tank that's in it is a custom built tank for the bike engine. I'll be honest it is home made so don't expect it to be perfect. It was built by myself and a pal. I have full v5 for the bike and the raptor in my name. Any other questions just ask. Has been sat over winter!! Sensible offers will be considered.</description>

        <description>2016 Sym Symphony ST 200i 3 Years Warranty Unveiled at the Milan Motorcycle Show (EICMA) only in November 2014, the Symphony ST launches in the UK in March 2015. Although it shares the 'Symphony' name with the S and SR, this version only carries over 15% of the parts from its sibling models. With 85% of the machine being 'all new' starting with the engine - up in power - down in emissions, the chassis is stiffened, the fairing more modern and elegant, the seat more comfortable, new style wheels, and fantastic all new LCD instrumentation, this latest incarnation of the popular Symphony series will set the benchmark for the next generation of 'high wheel' scootering.

        <description>Ktm 85 sx Runs perfect lots of power, front end lifts up constantly even with a 22 year old man on it. It has just had a new piston and little end bearing replaced from ktm. The bike needs a spot weld on the kick start or the screw boring out as it has snapped inside. Also the clutch needs bleeding. No time wasters and stupid offers as I just won't respond and I'm in no rush to sell. Thankyou</description>

        <description>For sale is my 1989 Honda CD 250U. Its currently on sorn and is mot'd to October. The V5 is present and i have owned it for 5 years. Im selling as i have bought a larger bike. The bike runs and rides well and is very clean for being 27 years old. It has 2 new tyres and has been looked after both mechanically and cosmetically. I have used it to travel to work and it will average 70 miles to the gallon. It can be insured as a classic or as normal , it was £ 120 to tax , mot and insure for a year last time. Bike has never let me down and starts first push of the button, as said it runs well and would be ideal for commuting. I'm an older rider and have riden it sensibly and not thrashed or raced it. There are some small marks still present prior to my ownership but very minor. There's a top box to go with it and a repair manual. Worth a viewing.</description>

        <description>Selling my Piaggio MP3 300 LT - Has a full service history and has been maintained by Central Bikes on Charlotte Street in central London for the last 2 years - runs perfectly, tyres in excellent condition, brakes sharp etc If you're looking you probably already understand these bikes - fundamental benefit is that you can ride them without a bike license and just on a standard car license. I had a Honda PCX originally for commuting into London but wanted something quicker for the A4 from Twickenham and got this, top speed of c.80mph but happily up to and nimble around 60mph for filtering through traffic - would highly recommend, only replacing as buying a brand new one having sold my car. PX have been quoted £3k and private list price on most sites seems to be c.£3.5k, I'd like to get rid this week so will let it go for £3.3k but no further negotiation Will only let someone test drive it if they bring and leave the full payment with me, you crash it you bought it. Located in Twickenham, evening viewings preferred and good to ride away, day time viewing possible by exception</description>

        <description>Selling the mint KAWASAKI EL250, as its just sat there in the garage since i stripped and rebuilt it about 18 months ago. Its done just under 16000 miles, and the engine is ultra quiet, with no smoking! The forks have been stripped and polished, as has the top fork bracket. Any bits that were rusty have been powder coated. It has quality chromed metal grille indicators , and has had the seats professionally recovered. It has a brand new GRIPS, stainless brake hose and pads fitted. The chrome on the wheels is all good too. TheTyres and Chain/Sprockets are fine too. All chrome on the fittings are spot on. This bike is perfect for the shorter rider as its got a really low seat height, and weighs about the same as a 125cc Kawasaki use the GPX250 engines in these, so they are no slouch! The bike has an unusual reg plate valued at £250+ I will put a full 12 months MOT on it for buyer.</description>

        <description>2005 Honda Blackbird CBR1100XX-4 Presented in Brown/Black with a Gold sparkle custom paint, looks amazing, comes with Givi Wingrack2 and Givi Panniers as pictured. This is a lovely bike runs rides and stops with no issues, very fast stable bike. Has a few extras to include; Custom Paintwork with Carbon Detailing, Tinted Double Bubble Screen, Black Padded Tank Protector, Custom Seat with CBR 1100XX inscription, Quill Exhaust Rear Cans which gives a lovely deep rumble plus road legal, Clear front and rear indicators, Gold dress up bolts etc etc. Mileage is warranted with VOSA and HPI. Now sadly the bike has had an insurance claimed against it, registered as a Cat D back in 2012, this was very minor panel damage and i did have pictures from previous owner of damage, was offside fairings, all repaired no problems. Its recently had a new Gold DID chain and sprockets, plus full service new plugs, oil filters etc this was at 35k, it wants for nothing and Spring/Summer coming soon..... Open to px car/bike/van welcome good trade prices paid, this is a bargain for a 2005 Blackbird</description>

        <description>Here for sale is my 2015 Lexmoto xtrS125cc motorcycle, barely run in, 5 speed manual virtually the same as the Honda CBR125 but for a third of the price ! As you would expect it starts very easily and runs and rides like a new bike having only done 1500 miles ( display is in KM and shows @ 2600km), never been dropped without a scratch on the bike it is literally in mint condition. The headlamps are excellent and light everything in front of you at night, everything works exactly as it should, it does around 80 miles per gallon and will do 70mph. Fully learner legal. The brakes and tyres are like new and don't look as if they have done any miles at all still with the paint lines and bobbles on them. Any questions please message through Gumtree email or call bike is located in Hoddesdon EN11.... I will not answer scam texts asking me to email you... Close 0ffers only considered once you have seen it and are standing in front of me with the cash.</description>

        <description>The time has come to sell my V-strom 1000. I'm the 2nd owner and have owned the bike for over 3 years, it's covered just 15k but that might go up a little. The condition is stunning, I'm a big fan of ACF50 and it shows, you'd never think the bike is an '06 Here is the spec: If you've research DL1000's you've read about the clutch chudder issues, I've had the 'Sharelike' clutch mod done, no more chudder and now it pulls smoothly from idle in every gear, easily the best £350 I've spent on a bike MTC open cans, the bike sounds awesome but there are baffles if you need them! Power Commander, silky smooth now Super Brace fork brace, the bike felt vague in fast corners but now it's tighten up nicely Off road foot pegs Scott oiler with dual injector Cymarc gear change enhancer Cymarc top box plate Fender extender MRA Touring screen Braided brake lines back and front Recent brake service Mirror extenders Aprilia mirrors Bar risers Touratech Sat Nav Mount Stainless oil cooler guard 12v supply under the seat and on the bars. Hand guard extenders (really really useful) Top box, panniers, centre stand, heated grips (all the GT bits) 400 miles on a new rear Tourance, there's a couple of thousand miles left in the front I'll leave the drift mounts on, the fairing one is very stable Bike is MOT's until 27th April 2017. There's service history up to 8k and I've serviced it since then. Both keys and owners manuals are supplied. I've spent a fortune on the bike and I love it but the time has come for a change, the first to see will buy. No test rides without proof of insurance and cash in my hand. Thanks for looking</description>

I have owned owned for the past four years and done 7000mls and there is now 11188 miles on the clock and its a great reliable bike. Brand new front tire and replaced in 2015 and brand new battery. MOT until September 2016 and done 20 miles since the MOT last year!! If your a surfer it comes with custom made board racks too!! Great bike for learning or just cruising.

Please call 078989535163 Please note. I shall not send any details by email. I have been contacted by many con artists looking for me to deposit more money than is asked, so please if you are one of these people don't bother!!!! I'm looking to sell this bike to people who really want to buy, not those interested but haven't got the money just yet. If you would like to view the bike please call.</description>

        <description>I am selling my Yamaha Diversion because I am leaving the UK. It is an old bike working very well but many things needs to be done on it: change rear break, change rear tyre, the current tyre is flat so it is not possible to drive it, change the battery, change clutch cable. The second speed is not working very well. As all this is to be done I sell it just 250£. Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to see it.</description>

        <description>Turismo Veloce is the boldest bike ever made by MV Agusta. This time we didn't take our inspiration from our 75 world titles or our legendary riders to set new speed or power records. We did, however, accept a challenge that was perhaps even more difficult, at least for us who feel at home on the track and are often the first to see the chequered flag flying: to make an MV Agusta touring bike The fact that it is also "Veloce" (fast) is the natural consequence. Giovanni Castiglioni. This meant redefining the design priorities: comfort, cargo capacity, smooth operation, low fuel consumption, longer service intervals and everything else a customer looks for in a bike designed for touring. Available in two versions, both share the absolute best technology available today: from the MVCSC (MV Agusta Chassis Stability Control) electronics package to the MVICS 2.0 (Motor &amp; Vehicle Integrated Control System) with inertial platform and the latest generation Bosch ABS. In typical MV Agusta style, we decided to adopt the electronic up&amp;down EAS 2.0 gearbox available on all the engine maps, even on this touring bike. The overall innovation of the design also comes through in the details, such as the Full LED light clusters, the colour instrumentation with TFT technology, built-in Bluetooth device to allow up to 9 different devices to be paired, the immobilizer, two USB sockets and two 12V power points. The Lusso (luxury) version takes the technical level of the Turismo 800 even higher with electronically controlled semi-active suspension as standard equipment, as well as heated hand grips, a centre stand and built-in GPS sensor. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AVAILABLE IN COLORS: PEARL WHITE / AVIO GREY RED / SILVER TURISMO VELOCE 800 LUSSO £ 14.199* WITH ABS BOSCH 9 PLUS RLM (REAR WHEEL LIFT-UP MITIGATION) EAS 2.0 Price shown is plus on the road costs, contact today 01934 621187 and one of the team will be more than happy to facilitate any queries you may have.

        <description>Turismo Veloce is the boldest bike ever made by MV Agusta. This time we didn't take our inspiration from our 75 world titles or our legendary riders to set new speed or power records. We did, however, accept a challenge that was perhaps even more difficult, at least for us who feel at home on the track and are often the first to see the chequered flag flying: to make an MV Agusta touring bike The fact that it is also "Veloce" (fast) is the natural consequence. Giovanni Castiglioni. This meant redefining the design priorities: comfort, cargo capacity, smooth operation, low fuel consumption, longer service intervals and everything else a customer looks for in a bike designed for touring. Available in two versions, both share the absolute best technology available today: from the MVCSC (MV Agusta Chassis Stability Control) electronics package to the MVICS 2.0 (Motor &amp; Vehicle Integrated Control System) with inertial platform and the latest generation Bosch ABS. In typical MV Agusta style, we decided to adopt the electronic up&amp;down EAS 2.0 gearbox available on all the engine maps, even on this touring bike. The overall innovation of the design also comes through in the details, such as the Full LED light clusters, the colour instrumentation with TFT technology, built-in Bluetooth device to allow up to 9 different devices to be paired, the immobilizer, two USB sockets and two 12V power points. The Lusso (luxury) version takes the technical level of the Turismo 800 even higher with electronically controlled semi-active suspension as standard equipment, as well as heated hand grips, a centre stand and built-in GPS sensor. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AVAILABLE IN COLORS: SILVER / AVIO GREY RED / SILVER TURISMO VELOCE 800 £ 11.899* WITH ABS BOSCH 9 PLUS RLM (REAR WHEEL LIFT-UP MITIGATION) EAS 2.0 Price shown is plus on the road costs, contact today 01934 621187 and one of the team will be more than happy to facilitate any queries you may have.

        <description>Nice clean 1993 KLX 650 11 months MOT Starts on the button and runs great. All electrics and charging system working properly inc manual fan control and temp gauge fitted. New Reg/Rec. Heated grips. New chain fitted today. New swingarm needle bearings, collars and dust seals fitted today. Recent rear Cush drive, valve clearance check, rear wheel bearing and oil. Newly greased suspension linkages and collars. Fork seals good and tyres good. Ready to ride away! I'm selling it as I bought it last year to get around town and do some green laning on but I've not used it much in 10 months. It's been great fun but I've a baby on the way so cd do with the cash. There is heat damage to the rhs rear panel where it was pressed against the exhaust by luggage. The rear brake light switch has just broken but I've ordered a replacement and happy to fit for buyer or give away with bike. Also got rad fins with bike. I've had a lot of small maintenance based jobs done over the last year and it's running great. It pulls brilliantly and sounds good but not too loud (marving exhaust) I can't verify mileage beyond the MOTS I have (the last 5) and the checks I did when I bought the bike last year (text check) but it runs perfectly. Any questions feel free give me a buzz or come and check it over for yourself. It's stored in a garage I rent from the council so will need a small amount of notice before viewings. It's local to me though so easy to arrange.</description>

Plus new tyres. Immobiliser and alarm with 4 button remote. Black evo panels in near mint condition. Brand new inner panels. Renthal Fat Bar, Oxford heated grips with high and low settings. Hebo stem and Koso clocks along with Stage6 switches. Dual USB charging port. LED back lights. The frame has also been reinforced to add more strength and stability to cope with the power. Everything is in perfect working order. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with it whatsoever! Cash on collection and any test rides are welcome when money is in my hand.

        <description>When attention to detail brings limited-edition precision to production bikes. When performance bursts through the boundaries of logic. Then, and only then does MV Agusta add the RR badge to a model. Top-drawer features, cutting-edge components and radical design choices: a combination that leaves no room for compromise. Every single MV Agusta is exceptional: an MV Agusta RR is the authentic essence of pure, electrifying riding pleasure. The RR badge, until now reserved for only the best 4-cylinder MV bikes, now takes the in-line 3-cylinder range by storm. And it does so with the Brutale 800 Dragster RR, a combination of power, style, superb chassis design and sheer brute force. In a class of its own, it lies beyond both comparison and competitors. Because it is, even with its painstakingly crafted details, emblematic of a return to the essential. Pure thrills. Absolute exuberance. The Brutale Dragster 800 RR radicalises the “stoplight burner” concept that MV Agusta reintroduced with the Brutale Dragster, a bike designed, quite literally, to be breathtaking. Every twist of the throttle, every release of the clutch, every gear change. One goal: to unleash all its horsepower onto the tarmac. With the Dragster 800, MV Agusta pushed the envelope. With the Brutale 800 Dragster RR, MV Agusta pushes even farther. More horsepower. More electronics. An even more brazen look. You couldn't ask for more. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Specification In detail, the main features of MV Agusta Brutale 800 Dragster RR: In-line three-cylinder engine, 798 cc Bore 79.0 mm, stroke 54.3 mm Maximum power 140 HP-EC (103 kW) at 13,100 rpm Maximum torque 86 Nm at 10,100 rpm Rev limiter at 13,200 rpm Dry weight 168 kg Power-to-weight ratio 1.19 kg/HP Tyres Pirelli DIABLO Rosso II 120/70 - ZR 17 (front) and 200/50 – ZR 17 (rear) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AVAILABLE IN COLORS: PEARL SHOCK RED / PEARL ICE WHITE PEARL SHOCK RED / CARBON METALLIC BLACK BRUTALE 800 DRAGSTER RR £ 13.449 Price shown is plus on the road costs, contact today 01934 621187 and one of the team will be more than happy to facilitate any queries you may have.

        <description>Here's my 2008 Yamaha YZF r125. All it needs is 2 new tyres and it's ready for an MOT! Only plastics it needs is boomerangs, may need a new battery too as current one doesn't hold charge, but does need tlc. I have loads of paperwork including full service history logbook. The bike has no write off history so can be repaired and taken straight for an MOT. Just had brand new front brake pads and both calipers serviced and rebled. With its quick action quarter throttle the bike is able to redline at a quarter way of turning the throttle. Very responsive. I'm willing to take £1200 for the bike. Im aware its worth a lot more in parts and will take no less. Contact me on 07541015054. If I dont answer im busy, so text me and I'll text back.</description>

        <description>Regrettably selling my beloved Benelli Tornado TRE 900. It’s a chance to own a unique Italian crowd stopper (cooling fans at rear)!!! This 2005 bike has covered only 7500 m. Fitted with rare Titanium exhaust (£1500) from Benelli when new. With colour matched wheels and improved windscreen. Extras:- spare standard exhaust, standard windscreen, immobiliser and new cover. Solid service history. Not ridden in the rain or winter and kept covered. Sadly I dropped her on a gravel patch and she is scratched on the left. All other minor repairs completed by Moto Corsa of Shaftesbury. Brand new MOT. Will hold its value. Priced to sell £2900</description>

Images for illustration purposes only, graphics kit included in price, all other extras subject to price increase, please contact your local dealer for more information The Star Manual was our first love. Now she's all grown up and the only metal bodied traditional scooter in the World. She shifts like a sports car and gets up to 140mpg. Her four stroke engine makes the Star Manual one of the cleanest, greenest scooters out there. Her vintage colours and retro vibe remain the same. She's a timeless beauty, at home in any decade. We are very excited by the latest range of LML scooters. The 200cc four-stroke engine is designed for high performance and high mileage, while maintaining the retro scooter styling. Characterised by high reliability, the Star 4 Stroke 200cc has literally been designed to last forever. The Star 4 Stroke 200cc scooter is big news. The scooters styling has been updated with a number of improvements on previous models including chrome-plated turn indicators and saddle designed for both comfort and that all important vintage, retro look. LML has paid particular attention to rider safety by upgrading the front headlamp to include an internal parabola lens for a more powerful beam of light. The rear lights have also been upgraded to increase lighting and reflectors have been added to the mudguards. The instrument panel has been enhanced with a warning light which tells you when the scooter is in neutral and one when the brake pedal is pressed.

        <description>The exhilaration of a 1000 cc bike, the handling of a 600. The torque of a twin, the acceleration of a four-cylinder. The MV Agusta F3 800 pushes back the performance barriers, thanks to Italian-made 3-cylinder engine excellence. More power, more torque, more adrenaline. The outcome? A motorcycle with exceptional handling, an advanced electronics package and a new 800 cc engine that punches out 148 hp and 88 Nm of torque. Coupled with a super-low weight of 173 kg, the resulting power-to-weight ratio puts it in a position to do battle with litre-class Sportbikes. The MV Agusta F3 675 redefined the mid-weight Supersport concept by offering up a perfect engine-chassis balance, a power unit packed with quintessential Italian technology and a chassis with class-leading performance on both road and track. The MV Agusta F3 800 goes even further, pushing the mid-range Supersport boundaries all the way up to Superbike replica level thanks to a segment-revolutionising design that is nothing less than a technological and performance milestone. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Specification Three-cylinder inline 798 cc engine Bore 79.0 mm, stroke 54.3 mm (8.4 mm more than the F3 675) Max. power 148 hp at 13,000 rpm (20 hp more than the F3 675) Max. torque 88 Nm at 10,600 rpm 13,500 rpm limiter Slipper clutch Dry weight: 173 kg (same as the F3 675) Power-to-weight ratio: 1.17 kg/hp (13.5% less than the F3 675, which has a ratio of 1.35 kg/hp) New front brake set-up with Brembo monobloc calipers • Pirelli Diablo Rosso Corsa tyres -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AVAILABLE IN COLORS: MATT METALLIC SENNA BLACK PEARL ICE WHITE / MATT AVIO GREY RED / AGO SILVER Price shown is plus on the road costs, contact today 01934 621187 and one of the team will be more than happy to facilitate any queries you may have.

        <description>Testing the water, not in rush to sell but open to it if price is right. Kawasaki ER6F, bought approximately 1.5 years ago from Shirlaws after passing my A2 test, looking to sell as I plan on upgrading my license during the summer to A license and I already have an R6 in the garage already waiting for me. Yes, the bike has been ridden in all weather, and on a few moderate distance trips (200 miles). You would be silly to believe adverts that tell you "fair weather only". And it is not in perfect condition aesthetically and the price reflects this. However, it has been looked after at reputable garages, has a full service history, and has never been dropped. Mechanically, it is sound. It has also been stored in dry garages since I took ownership. These A2 compliant sports-touring style bikes are a great stepping stone for most new riders, lots of usable power without getting boring and not a bike you'll get into too much danger with. They are easy going into corners and great around town. Ideally I'd like to keep this bike for years when I eventually upgrade my license, however its not really feasible in the current economic climate to be taxing, insuring and servicing two bikes and one car, so I need to scale down. Currently, it is restricted by Shirlaws to A2 compliance, however this is easily removed should the user hold a full license. Viewings welcome, however I am limited in time until the 2nd May, so if you are in a rush to buy this bike I may not be able to help. Also happy to put through new MOT for buyer peace of mind. Think the old one runs out around June. Also worth mentioning its fitted with a tail tidy. Please text me rather than call if interested, please no time wasters and scammers don't even bother, I wasn't born yesterday!</description>

        <description>Please see for sale my BMW R1150R Rockster. I bought it a week and half ago, and it was delivered Last Monday, It is in absolutely lovely condition and is very evident that it was the previous owners pride and Joy. I can not seriously fault the bike one iota... However I have never previously owned or sat on a Rockster and after the first journey on it decided it was not for me, I don't particularly like the ride position and other niggles that relate to the ride experience, and not to the bike itself.... The Bike features : * Comprehensive BMW Service History. * BMW heated grips * Colour matched centre stand * Pyramid rear hugger * Stainless Steel “Carbon Can Co” silencer and free breathing exhaust Y piece * HID headlights (plus original parts to return to standard if required). * There are 2 keys for the bike and the original owners pack with Riders Manual and Maintenance Instructions/Service Book and a CD-ROM with downloaded maintenance manual, original Rockster marketing brochure and a useful collection of web based resources * Pannier rails * BMW system cases (with locks matched to ignition key) * Genuine BMW inner pannier bags * Genuine BMW tank bag with rain cover * BMW rear rack. * Autocom 300 ProAVI communications system * Garmin Zumo 550 with latest mapping, car mounting kit, charger, leads etc. * Ram Handlebar Mount * Lockable stainless steel Touratech Zumo cradle * Baglux Bagster Tank Cover * Cylinder guards * GS Hand guards * Wunderlich screen * Rider and passenger comfort seats * Optimate 3+ battery conditioner * Original full exhaust system * Spare Oil Filter * Oil Filter Removal Tool * Haynes Service Manual Feel Free to come and view, as mentioned it is a fantastic looking bike, and if you are suited to a sports touring ride position, it'll be just the bike for you. The only blemish seen is where the previous owner accidentally left his disc lock on, and it caught the front Mudguard. He then effected the repair seen. Cash or Bank transfer only please, pick up within 3 days of purchase.</description>

        <description>Custom built motorcycle trailer Aluminum threadplate floor Knott galvanised torsion suspension Strong frame up to 750kg Spare wheel Matching new tyres 13" wheels Jockey wheel New number plate lights Galvanised mud guards Trailer was built in Austria in 1999. I have bought it from the second owner this year to bring over my motorbike to the UK. It had an mot check by a local garage before I left for the 1000 mile journey and everything was spot on. Got 3 new tyres and installed a Sealey front wheel chock. All lights have been checked over and installed new number plate lights. I have done the journey without any problems whatsoever, the trailer is balanced really good no bouncing or jumping and can be towed empty. Unfortunately I have no space for it hence selling it. I couldn't find anything near as good as this trailer in the UK for the price. I have paid €700, the one I found in the UK similar to this was £990. I will be open to sensible offers. Cash on collection. Can be delivered within a reasonable distance for the right price. Location is South East London, Bexleyheath. Only 10 minutes from the M25 and 5 minutes from the A2. Thanks for looking!</description>

        <description>For sale is my stunning KTM Duke. The bike looks superb and has that big bike look and feel. It has a meta Alarm and Immobiliser with 2 keys and 2 fobs. the bike is MOT'd. It has a load of extras which include anodized orange Levers, gear selector and rear brake pedal, handle bar clamp, Brake reservoir, rear sprocket and chrome and orange radiator guard. As of today I have change the oil (Castrol edge), Spark plug (NGK), race oil filter and rear brake pads. The bike has full service history up to 9k miles. in the last 300 miles I have fitted new Bridgestone tyres, also replaced the chain (also bought front and rear sprockets but haven't replaced them as the ones fitted are like new, But new ones will be included in sale). Also fitted is a new larger front screen as the original is very small (included in sale). I have also fitted an R&amp;G tail tidy which really sets the back end off. It rides spot on and wants for nothing. You wont find a better bike with all the upgraded parts. Only selling due to passing my test. First to see will buy. Thanks</description>

        <description>After being elected the “World’s Best-Looking 600”, the MV Agusta F3 675 is now ready to lead the pack on both street and track. Featuring the new MVICS (Motor &amp; Vehicle Integrated Control System) platform, this Supersport boasts an ultra-advanced chassis and cutting-edge technology on a par with the best litre-class bikes. Nothing less than revolutionary, the MV Agusta F3 675 is a thoroughbred thrill-generator on street or track. The unique 3-cylinder engine – with a counter-rotating crankshaft, a ground-breaking solution previously seen only on MotoGP bikes – and the ultra-compact lightweight layout are just two of many qualities that make the new F3 675 a Supersport of unrivalled sophistication – and an incomparable ride. A look at the MV Agusta F3 675 power unit quickly identifies it as the most advanced, powerful mid-weight engine ever built. A tightly compact in-line 3-cylinder with a perfect combination of forward-thinking mechanical engineering, extremely advanced materials and futuristic electronics. The MVICS system makes it the first mid-weight motorcycle to feature Full Ride By Wire control and, as a result, 4 engine maps (one of which can be customised) and 8-level traction control. The chassis is a gem too: designed and developed to maximise dynamic performance, it offers optimum rigidity, giving a ‘feel’ that is, under all riding conditions, in a class of its own compared to other motorcycles in this category. MV Agusta F3 675 styling development has remained faithful to the philosophy that has characterized all previous MVs: a perfect balance of form and function that merge to create a bike unique not only for its panache but also for its astounding performance. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AVAILABLE IN COLORS: RED / AGO SILVER PEARL WHITE MATT AVIO GREY F3 675 EAS ABS Price shown is plus on the road costs, contact today 01934 621187 and one of the team will be more than happy to facilitate any queries you may have.

        <description>2013 Yamaha WR125X Lovely bike very low mileage of 1959 miles. never had an issue with the bike in almost 3 years of ownership since new. The MOT runs out this month however will fly through as it has been meticulously maintained, Also has full service history to back this up. Just had a brand new chain and sprocket fitted. New mirrors (originals come with bike) it has been lowered 20mm (original kit comes with bike can be swapped back if new owner wishes) only other modification is the Evotech tail tidy (original comes with bike) Its been a lovely bike however new car forces sale. any questions please don't hesitate to ask.</description>

        <description>SOLD AS SEEN We are selling our Vespa because we simply do not use it. It has been parked on our drive for nearly two years so the battery is drained and it has no MOT. It was involved in a minor accident 2 years ago which meant we had to replace and repaint the front of the scooter but other than that, and a few scratches and scrapes (the scooter is 3rd hand) it is absolutely fine and would be a fantastic bike for a project or parts. We have all the documentation and log book to hand. We are selling this along with two Shark Helmets, barely used. One is a Large and one is a Small. COLLECTION ONLY - TWICKENHAM TW2</description>

On the move, the liquid-cooled V-twin engine is not particularly powerful, but allows relaxed, economical progress. The soft suspension and shaft drive discourages sporty riding, but the Deauville is still commendably rapid across town or country roads. It is also popular with fleet users, and police, paramedic and courier Deauvilles are a common sight across Europe.</description>

        <description>Hello, I am selling my Yamaha YBR 125. South West London, Roehampton. About the bike: &gt; 2013 &gt; I am second owner &gt; 7000+ miles only &gt; Rear tire is changed few months ago &gt; In good working condition &gt; Back top case included, as well Oxford chain is included if you will want to keep it &gt; Some minor scratches: on the petrol tank (in photo), on front plastic cover, clutch is a bit bent but it is very minor and does not feel at all, maybe 1 or 2 degrees other small marks. It felt couple of times: first of previous owner and second happened when storm knocked my bike during the night. &gt; There is two set of keys, separate for ignition and separate for petrol tank. It is because i changed the ignition, somebody tried to steal it once and damaged an ignition switch. &gt; Mechanic serviced just couple of months ago: some of light bulbs been changed and minor works done as well ignition switch changed as i said. &gt; Extensions added on the mirrors, therefore there is a bigger view angle, more safe for learners. &gt; L plates included (front and rear). This is great bike and suits well in London for commuting, it served me well and it is still in very good shape, i would keep it for another half year but i am going for a holidays soon.</description>

Couple of dents on tank by previous owner and missing marauder badges because of this. Also a plastic bag got caught on the exhaust. Will probably come off, but i never tried. (Again, i refer to my previous 'lazy ' comment) Anyway, feel free to ring or text. Its a lovely bike. U wont be dissapointed. May consider a sensible offer. Comes with rear seat, cover and heavy duty chain. Also have clothing available, hardly worn. Please ask</description>

        <description>£1599 +OTR KYMCO SUPER 8 50 2 STROKE - Sporty style and great looks set this scooter apart from its rivals. With deep, shiny paintwork and great looking graphics the Super 8 punches well above its weight. A True Winner With its sharp sports bike styling, deep shiny paintwork and great looking graphics, the Super 8 50 cc 2-stroke looks fantastic and is great to ride. It is both light and agile, which makes it great fun to ride and it is more than capable of swiftly manoeuvring around a congested town or city. The Super 8 50 2-stroke recently triumphed on The Gadget Show ‘Top 5 Scooter' feature. The Scooter not only made Suzi Perry's Top 5, but came Third overall, beating off stiff competition from the Peugeot Speedfight 3 and Piaggio NRG. The TV show's presenter Suzi Perry, also a keen motorcyclist, tested and reviewed more than forty 50cc scooters for the feature. Commenting on the KYMCO Super 8 50, Suzi said: "Unlike some other 2-strokes this is quite smooth. This is a bike you feel like you can just throw around... keep the revs on... it's really lovely to ride." Fuel-efficient and Environmentally Friendly The Super 8 is a highly fuel-efficient scooter, capable of achieving in excess of 80 miles per gallon as well as producing very low carbon emissions. Perfect Learner and Commuter Companion More than capable of swiftly moving around a congested town or city, the Super 8 50 boasts 14" six-spoke alloy wheels and a long wheel base, to further enhance stability, comfort and safety. The relitively low seating position at 785mm in height ensures the rider can easily place their feet on the ground making it ideal for both male and female riders. Pillions are well catered for, with pop-out alloy foot pegs and a grab rail, so you can share your journey with a friend if the mood takes you. Other features include: powerful front disc and rear drum brakes, electric and kick-start, automatic choke, lockable under seat storage box for helmet, shopping or waterproofs, steering lock, rear carrier, centre and side stands 2 Year Warranty The Super 8 50 2-Stroke comes with a 2-year unlimited mileage manufacturer's warranty.</description>

        <description>1996 Honda CB500 This bike has done be well over the last two years. It has signs of a hard life e.g. surface rust, chipping paint (previous owner sprayed engine black). It has recently had some fueling issues so intermittently running, once its going it runs great. It has restricter discs at the carbs to take it down to 48bhp (A2). DID X-ring Chain and sprockets have plenty of life left in them. Fitted with crash bars, mirrors, all body work, aftermarket exhaust (previous owner) and fly screen. Engine and carbs seem in good condition and just need tweaking to sort fuelling. All electrics work, side stand switch disconnected by previous owner. MOT until June 24th. WORK NEEDED: downpipe gaskets and fixings need replaced as exhaust gases can be seen escaping at engine casing, one of the downpipe mounts has sheered and needs drilled and replaced. Could do with tuning to sort fuelling issue. These bikes are known for cheap and available parts. V5 in my name, viewing recommended (evenings or weekends). Could be used as spares and repairs for anyone racing Cb's. Open to offers, bike will need collected, ideally by van or trailer. SPARE ENGINE can also be sold with bike for additional cost. This is currently in Scotland but can be brought down at a later date. I have not run it but was told its running and in good condition when I got it with the bike as a spare.</description>

        <description>Throttle wide open. Engine at peak revs. The rear wheel spinning as it tries to gain traction. White smoke, tyre squeal and unrestrained power as the wheel bites into the tarmac and devours it, mile after mile. The MV Agusta Brutale 800 Dragster is all this and much more. It is motorcycling as it was meant to be. Pure riding pleasure. Full-on fun and freedom. MV Agusta continues to expand its motorcycle range: after introducing the Rivale 800, a symbol of motard-style sports appeal and ultra-dynamic road performance, the new Brutale 800 Dragster makes the term 'motorcycling passion' breathtakingly tangible. No mere means of transport, a motorcycle symbolises freedom, our need to get out there and explore, to savour mile after spine-tingling mile and experience every second of that freedom to the max. The new Brutale 800 Dragster embodies the ambitions and dreams of every biker and transforms them into on-the-road reality. Electrifying, unforgettable moments. The 3-cylinder Brutale 675 and 800 have introduced countless riders to the awesome buzz that goes with riding a high-performance naked bike. Outstanding ridability, controlled power, lightness, eye-catching design, and exceptional value for money. This unmatched combination has made the 3-cylinder Brutale a huge success. Now, the Brutale 800 Dragster takes a big step towards the future, yet does so with an attentive eye to the past. The most extreme Brutale ever is no fan of compromise: irreverent and brash, it is essential, brusque, outspoken and irascible. Packing a powerful punch, the Brutale 800 Dragster takes exhilaration to a whole new level. At the same time it draws on the ideas that shaped the first 4-cylinder Brutale bikes, the very essence of the naked concept and monuments to incomparable styling. The Brutale 800 Dragster embodies both experience and intuition, symbolising motorcycling past, present and… forever. Pure essence. Pure thrills. 100% Brutale. With consummate Italian craftsmanship, the Brutale 800 Dragster re-evokes the epic spirit of the “dragster” race bikes, specifically built to unleash their explosive power in the few seconds that separate clutch release from chequered flag. Seconds as scorching hot as the rubber left fuming on the tarmac. Seconds that end in the blink of an eye yet generate thrills to last a lifetime. The Brutale 800 Dragster flings open the doors to full-on freedom. On two wheels. Or even just one. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Specification Main characteristics of the MV Agusta Brutale 800 Dragster: In-line three-cylinder engine, 798 cc Bore 79.0 mm, stroke 54.3 mm Maximum power 125 hp (EU) (92 kW) at 11,600 rpm Maximum torque 81 Nm at 8,600 rpm Rev limiter at 13,000 rpm Dry weight 167 kg Power-weight ratio 1.34 kg/hp Tyres Pirelli DIABLO Rosso II 120/70 - ZR 17 front, 200/50 – ZR 17 rear -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AVAILABLE IN COLORS: PEARL ICE WHITE MATT BLACK BRUTALE 800 DRAGSTER £ 11.149 Price shown is plus on the road costs, contact today 01934 621187 and one of the team will be more than happy to facilitate any queries you may have.

        <description>My much loved Yamaha Fzr 400 1987 with 40,000miles Just had a fully synthetic oil change, new plugs, downpipes resprayed and new exhaust gaskets Stops and starts, although front break could do with bleeding (will try to sort before sale) Has custom bar risers, Hiflow air filter, decent premium tyres, grips and a swell sounding micron can MOT till 21 October 2016 Only used in dry weather when i've owned it as I have a car. Selling as i'm leaving the country to go back to the isle of man may18th Poetntially bike could do wtih rejetting (special, exhaust + highflow airfliter setup mean non stock carb settings), although most of the time nothing is noticeable, running a little rich will try to fix before sale. Happy to give a good link to an aftermarket fairing kit if your so inclined Vids available on request</description>

        <description>My Honda cb250 for sale. bought 2x weeks ago as a light touring bike but my circumstances have changed and I now need a 500/600cc bike for commuting as moving to Gravesend. this bike is very clean for it's age and you can tell it has never been in the hands of any motorbike schools or delivery drivers. It starts on the button with no smoke etc, gearbox is really tight and smooth and the power delivery is instant. The bodywork is very tidy. It's still in it's original red paint from 1996 with barely a scratch on her. The bike has been family owned for a number of years with only 4 previous owners Has extremely low mileage for year of 13,000 original miles backed up by lots of old MOTs etc. Has original handbook and service book with stamps Also features Givi screen and rear rack (ideal for top box) Would make great fist time bike, commuter etc. Bike is currently SORN and has no insurance as I haven't even used it since I bought it. Feel free to call me with any questions or to view 07792488377 - Charlie £750 o.n.o Cash on collection Collection only (will need trailer or insurance applied if riding away)</description>

        <description>Yamaha XT 350 1992 model. An appreciating classic that’s becoming very rare and hard to come by. Runs well and starts first time, everything works as it should. Fitted with a new coil and has a few spare parts including spare side panels (old but ideal if you want to go off road) fuel tap, right side engine casing and oil filter cover, new unused hand guards, Haynes Manual, 2 keys and genuine Yamaha oil filter. Previous owner was a mechanic so I’m quite positive the engine has been looked after otherwise I wouldn’t have bought as the XT engines are bomb proof. Please note I have no service history. V5 in my name .Currently on SORN and no MOT. Please bear in mind that this is a 24 year old trail bike with the odd mark, and scratch and has been used for its intention. Classic insurance costing me £60 a year. Simply jump on and hit the trails or keep as a superb base for a restoration project, either way you won’t lose money on it. I am no rush to sell so no silly offers please; if it doesn’t go then I will keep it for the summer as it’s a pleasure to ride. Genuine enquires only please. No swaps, cash buyers only. Viewing welcome. Any question please call or text on 07855471051 Thanks for looking</description>

        <description>Had this since new. It is a 2005 reg. It is registered as a 50cc, but has a 110cc engine in and makes the ride a lot nicer. I've spent a lot of money on it over the years, but haven't had the time to ride it. It is currently in storage and requires a new back tyre. I haven't started it for a while either but it should start fine with some fresh fuel. It is a copy of a Honda, although as good quality as one, with lots of genuine Honda parts. Great looking and sounding bike. It hang got any MOT etc but we can come to a deal in sure. Any questions, it is best to text me. Thanks £750</description>

        <description>PRICE LOWERED DUE TO URGENT SALE. This is a Gilera Runner VX 125 thats been professionally fitted with a Vespa GTS 300 engine, so you can ride it on a provisional licence (CBT). Very nice, very reliable and very fast. Loads of money spent on it and I do have most receipts for proof. Unkown genuine mileage of the Vespa 300 engine but i know that it came out of a 2010 bike. It is also still in everyday use to get me to work and back... Full v5 logbook. MOT until March 2017. Has recently been serviced; new oil and filter, air filter, brake pads, rollers and drive belt. Plus new tyres. Immobiliser and alarm with 4 button remote. Black evo panels in near mint condition. Brand new inner panels. Renthal Fat Bar, Oxford heated grips with high and low settings. Hebo stem and Koso clocks along with Stage6 switches. Dual USB charging port. LED back lights. The frame has also been reinforced to add more strength and stability to cope with the power. Everything is in perfect working order. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with it whatsoever! Cash on collection and any test rides are welcome when money is in my hand. For anymore information please feel free to contact me on 07572189079.</description>

        <description>For Sale My Direct Bikes 125 Need to sell my scooter as I'm not really using it because I've got a car, only really brought it as a toy. Its good fun to ride about on and is a lot quicker than you'd expect, will easy do 65mph but believe its still restricted and am told derestricted they will touch 85-90mph. Has had A new Head New bottom crush gasket New rocker Cover (and gasket) New exhaust gasket New tensioner gasket Fresh Oil Has brilliant Compression and pulls like a train Has a stainless back box (Pretty loud sounds good but may not be to everyone's taste) Starts first or second kick and used to start straight away on the electric start, but because its not bin used enough the battery is week, will turn the engine over but not start it, needs charging or a good run, at worst a new battery, but would try the other two first before waisting £15 on a new one. It has MOT till October and there are no advisories on the MOT, will easly pass in October as long as you look after it. Tires are Great still got loads of tread. Breaks are both sharp. All lights work Low Mileage, backed up by what is shown on the MOT certificate for previous readings. Full V5 in my name Can deliver if not to far ect... as still have my motor cross bike trailer. Am probably going to regret selling in a month or two when its hot but needs must. Any questions please email, call or text will get back to you May consider part ex for road legal bike/scooter something as a bit of a project but must be cash my way (could do with the money otherwise wouldn't be selling TBH) Price £450 ono</description>

        <description>£1899 +OTR KYMCO LIKE 125 - This high quality retro style scooter offers the very latest 21st century technology at an affordable price. Styled by Italian designer Massimo Zaniboni, who took his inspiration from classic scooters of the 1950s and ’60s. Retro chic scooter at an unbeatable price. With an ample top speed of 65 mph, coupled with a long wheelbase and 12-inch alloy wheels for added stability, the LIKE 125 is perfect for the city commute and day or weekend trips. Fuel-efficient and Environmentally Friendly Featuring an automatic transmission (simply twist and go), the LIKE is a modern day scooter powered by the latest low emission 4-stroke air-cooled engine, making it greener, more fuel-efficient and capable of achieving in excess of 100 miles per gallon. Pretty and Ultra Practical This scooter is definitely a looker due to the finish, build quality and retro details including chrome mirrors, pearlescent blue/black paintwork, wide body panels and a chrome surround halogen headlamp. It is also a practical scooter, with a lockable glovebox up front (with a 12-volt socket inside), storage space beneath the seat and a handy 30 litre top box as a standard fitment, which can be quickly removed if and when you don't need it. A bag hook at the front combined with a flat floor for maximum carrying capacity, while a neat cubby hole at the front will hold sunglasses, documents, a city pocket map etc. The LIKE boasts front and rear disc brakes, twin adjustable shocks at the rear and telescopic forks which help to provide a comfortable ride. Ideal for big city streets with nightmare traffic thanks to its compact dimensions and outstanding agility, it will also happily whizz down the motorways, the wide fairing shielding you from the elements, and the 12-inch alloy wheels and decent wheelbase keeping things stable. The instrument panel tells you how many miles you've covered and how much fuel you have and there's also a handy digital clock. Additional features include an electric and kick-start, automatic choke, steering lock, and centre and side stands. 2-Year Warranty The LIKE 125 comes with a 2-year unlimited mileage manufacturer's warranty.</description>

        <description>Honda C90 MG Cub Economy 1988. 21000 miles, MOT 10 months. Reliable and appreciating classic. All original Honda. This is the rarer model with electric start as well as kick. Also benefits from having the 'newer' 3 speed semi-automatic gearbox where you can go from 3rd straight to neutral when stopped...saves having to change back down through 2nd and 1st gear to get there! Some new bits recently fitted, though needs new seat cover. Only selling as have other bikes and this isn't getting used.</description>

        <description>This VN1500 is in excellent condition which lots of chrome. She comes with fringed leather panniers and tool roll. Has nice pointed handlebar balance weights too. Front tyre is very new and rear is very good also. I have several MOTs which back up the mileage of 22930. MOT is to 23 July although for the right price I'd put the bike though a MOT. She is a 98 R reg. Has Cobra exhausts .there is a leather tank chap. As I say the bikes rides very well but as a first cruiser it's not really my kind of thing. All offers considered. This bike is advertised elsewhere.</description>

        <description>For sale as I don’t ride it very much. Yamaha FZS 600 fazer 2001. Mot August . 29,500 miles. Runs and rides as it should with no known mechanical issues. Plenty of Service history. Every mot certificate. Avon Storm Ultra tyres front and back with plenty of tread, fitted at 26,000 miles. New chain. Fitted with Meta immobiliser with 2 remotes. Comes with three Yamaha keys. The not so good bits Left front fork needs cleaning up. Some damage to left side fairing, engine case, a very small dent in tank from slow speed incident in the wet on a diesel spill. I repaired this as a temporary measure in Dec 2011 when it happened with intention of doing it properly, however it does not affect the ride so have not bothered. Have covered 11,000 miles approx since. The bike is located just off M18 Jnc 4 Doncaster. More images available upon request, if you require a Test Ride you must have proof of insurance and a deposit of asking price will be required.</description>

        <description>I have owned this bike since 2010 and it has been a pleasure to ride. I have only used it on weekends for Sunday morning fun. It had 13000 miles clock on when i bought it and it now has only 17600 miles. So as you can see it has not had much use in the last six years. It has 12 Months M.O.T. and has no advisories. The bike had a 33bhp restriction kit fitted to it when i bought it as the previous keeper was a learner rider. I still have the installation certificate for the kit but the restriction kit has been removed and it is now full power. It is in great condition and rides really well. It starts first time every time and the engine sounds very good as you would expect. The bike is completely standard and original. The only downside is that the previous keeper dropped it on its right hand side at a junction and scratched the fairings lightly. The upper fairing was resprayed and the decal is missing but it could easily be replaced. This bike is fast becoming a classic and will only go up in value. The only reason i am selling is because i have now got three bikes and i cant ride them all. I am not desperate to sell so no silly offers please, but i will listen to sensible ones. CASH ON COLLECTION ONLY and no test rides unless the full price is in my hand and the rider has proof of insurance to ride the bike. I WILL ONLY ANSWER TO PHONE CALLS OR MESSAGE THROUGH GUMTREE. SCAMMERS AFTER MY BANK DETAILS WILL BE IGNORED. Thank you.</description>

        <description>A good example of the amazing G 650 GS. These bikes are very very economical and will return 70 mpg without much effort. The seat is comfortable and the bar position perfect for the long commute or a tour of Europe. It has a nearly new chain and sprockets, a centre stand, handguards and a remote rear shock adjuster. The bike rides beautifully and sounds great. The bike has a few marks and this reflected in the price. Cooperized are at 2 Spring Corner High Street Feltham TW134PA 0208 890 5353 Mon/Friday 09.00/17.30 Sat 09.00/16.30</description>

        <description>My daughters Suzuki RV125 Van Van 2006 for sale. Good condition with 12 months MOT. and 12530 miles.There is surface rust on the bike which I have treated with good quality rust preventer. The rear wheel is coated with it which spoils the look of the bike a bit but with some elbow grease could smarten it up- a job for the new owner .It looks better in the photos than it is ! I have priced the bike accordingly because of that so a cheap bike for someone. Offers invited. Bike situated Kingston upon thames.</description>

        <description>Bike has 12 months MOT - issued on Friday 18th March. High resolution photos - see link below Up for sale is my beloved VFR1200F, in colour White as you can see - a 2010 model (Manual). This has been a fabulous machine, with a powerful engine and handling that belies the touring ability of the bike. I won't say more - if you are here I am sure you already know all about the VFR1200F. So, down to the specifics of my bike: Mileage is 23600, but bike is used so may go up a little. The bike is stored in a garage and has been utterly reliable, starting first time despite weeks of non-use (typical Honda!) The Good: Helibars Handlebar Risers are fitted, R&amp;G Engine covers, Original Honda heated grips and a Givi luggage rack. Metzeler Z8 tyres (front and rear) were fitted new in July 2015. Only done about 800 miles since then. Aside from mentioned scuffs below, the bike is in good overall condition cosmetically and mechanically. The bike has full service history, the 2 original Honda keys plus a spare for the petrol tank. The Bad: In the first month of my ownership, the bike fell off the sidestand in very strong April wind. I had the bike sent to Galloways of Reading for repair....they replaced all broken parts except the upper fairing,barend and engine cover which is still lightly scuffed and rear right side silver plastic which has light scuff marks and is secure except when the seat is removed. I was lucky - most of the fall was taken by the Givi top box which is included if you need one. I was going to go for a White version which would look neater in my view. Viewing is highly recommended. Full asking price in cash required before any test ride. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks Nathanael. Bike is located in Reading, Berkshire. For high resolution photos, please email me and I will send you a link. Or better, come and view the bike.</description>

        <description>Ktm sx144 2008 £1500 no offers, no swaps, i bought this 6 month ago but have only used it once due to the tracks being shut over the winter and not having the time, when i bought it was serviced had the fork seals replaced and the gear and brake levers upgraded to rfx ones, the bikes in overall good condition however does have a small crack in the front and rear mudgaurd and other marks but to be expected with a bike of this age, the guy i bought it from showed me a old piston claiming he had changed the piston and fitted a new seal kit however i cannot prove this. The bike is sold as seen and a recipt will be given, call or text 07429379610, i cant always answer due to work but will reply when i can</description>

As you can see it's only done 3051 miles with a Full Service History. It will be MOT's for it's new owner. The bike has never seen rain, has never been used before April nor after September There will not be a better VFR out there. No test pilots, tyre kickers or agencies please. Registration Plate NOT included Only selling cause I've too many bikes and some aren't getting used enough Absolute Bargain</description>

        <description>50cc 4 stroke chopper for sale. Been sitting in the garden for quite a while so could do with a bit of tlc and a fresh lick of paint on the handle bars and other chrome bits. It starts runs and drives, just fitted a brand new carb and throttle cable to get it running and it runs sweet. Its barely been ridden - 394kilometers on the clock. Has a rev counter, speedo, 3 lights on the clock, headlight, horn and electric start. The battery needs replacing, rear brake cable needs unseizing or replacing, starter switch sorting and could ideally need a throttle handle and just general tlc. Perfect summer toy for a kid. Pick up from strood in medway or possible delivery if fuel cost covered. £180 07982420360</description>

        <description>Selling my LEXMOTO gladiator 125cc, has been used As a work horse going from a to b. Great bike and never let me down, starts and rides as it should. Reason for selling is because I'm moving abroad. Mileage is in km so, 168514km No MOT as I haven't got the time to put it through. The down side to the scooter would be that it needs the back break looking at as it just sticks on the wheel and doesn't release. Few scratches on body work also but nothing major as you can see from the pictures. I have been quoted the worth to be £550 so will be looking for that amount or nearest serious offer around that price for quick sale.</description>

Extras include Givi topbox with 2 keys and SPADA M (57-58cm) scooter helmet (if required). Will also throw in a heavy duty Motard cover which fits over the scooter even with a topbox on. Centre stand quite stiff as not being used (side stand works perfectly) and previous owner had the front mudguard repaired for crack but not repainted so looks like a scratch (third picture) Extremely comfortable ride thanks to its 16” wheels and great suspension. Open to reasonable offers once viewed.</description>

        <description>£3299 +OTR KYMCO DOWNTOWN 125I - This Sports-Commuter Scooter is already proving to be a big hit in Europe - stylish and practical for both city and leisure riders. The Downtown combines high performance with luxurious styling and leads the way in terms of comfort, security and safety. New Sports-Commuter Scooter The Downtown 125i has been engineered and aesthetically designed to deliver maximum technological performance and comfort. At the heart of the machine is KYMCO's new liquid cooled four-stroke, single cylinder, fuel injection engine, which has served to significantly enhance the machine's performance. The Downtown 125i can achieve a top speed of 70mph. Practical for City and Leisure Riders The Downtown 125i has a high quality sports look that is both stylish and practical. The modern styling is the work of Italian designer' Massimo Zaniboni, and every detail from the 'eagle-eyed' twin headlights, to the elegant instrument panel, the 12v phone / battery charger, the design of the air inlets on the body and the large under seat storage that can hold two helmets, has been carefully considered to ensure that it can satisfy the needs of both city and leisure riders worldwide. Designed for Comfort, Safety and Security Ride The Downtown 125i also benefits from additional technical enhancements, including a new transmission and ignition system with a high performance chassis, which KYMCO has designed to increase tension and provide a safer ride, a twin balance shaft that reduces engine vibration and improves rider comfort, and a redesigned CVT transmission system to enhance shift efficiency. For added security and stability, the robust chassis also features generously sized wheels (14-inch at the front and 13-inch at the rear) 2 Year Warranty The Downtown 125i comes with a 2-year unlimited mileage manufacturers warranty for additional peace of mind.</description>

        <description>Location: Gateshead, NE10 Original sale: Sepetember 2014 Condition: Very good, minor wear and tear as can be expected but I've kept this bike clean, safe and protected since getting it. Servicing: Second service due. Extras: All original documentation + a spare key. I added handguards for a bit of winter protection, and rear bobbins for a paddock stand (included to allow for servicing). L plates can be re-added if requested. Reason for sale: I used this bike as a learner until getting my full A license last year. Loved it but have since bought a bigger bike. This is an excellent first bike for learning on or if you don't want the trouble of getting a full license (or just aren't old enough!) , very well made with ABS which is missing from most other 125s.</description>

        <description>Spares or repair/unfinished project. Viewing welcome. Engine runs fine,pulls well start first time (even after winter). Used to drive to work for about one month. Changed oil and filter, front and rear brake pads, fitted xenon head light,welded exhaust, got aftermarket exhaust can so sounds like a "big bike", new battery last year. Got loads of extras: full body leaver suite(immaculate condition) plus helmet (not so good,but still usable). Extra engine 250 cc, yes 250! And it should fit easily, just need to put all parts together, coz last winter was too short and passed so fast so i wasn't able to do that... Got spare chain and clutch cable (currently no point to change) Loads of paperwork and receipts. Bad bits: no mot(don't think should be any issues,coz used to drive really well) scratches and some dents...need tlc and good cleaning. Difficult to put into neutral gear(need to do it really gently) Tried to be as honest as i can, anyway , any questions please ask, or come and see it Tipton area. Thanks, Mario 07578676760</description>

Kept in garage all year round. very few miles done since I bought as I only take out in good weather. Reason for selling is to buy a bigger bike with panniers to tour more. two keys with bike. Great bike especially for some one moving up to there first big bike. Great sound of the viper exhaust.</description>

        <description>SIDECAR - Yamaha XJ900F with Watsonian Squire sidecar This is a good honest outfit with a genuine 16,750 miles on her. Full M.O.T. ( M.O.T. shows only 400 miles in the last 5 years - as sadly the last owner, who owned the bike 7 years, his wife passed away and the outfit has stayed in the garage). Oil and filter changed by last owner before I bought her; he also fitted a new battery. Road Legal ( excellent condition ) Motad 4 -1 silencer. Recent new battery. Front brakes bled, new spark plugs and final drive oil changed. Heated grips fitted but not working ..you could attempt a repair or cut them off. Brand new Hagon shocks on the rear and new Hagons on the front about a year or so ago. This is a good solid and reliable outfit and viewing recommended as I believe first to see will buy. Handles superbly with the leading link front forks ( a 'must have' on any outfit ) and 14" wheels. Cruises at 60 - 70 ( about 6,000 rpm ) and runs superbly. Everything else works as it should. Shaft drive and aircooled. No tool kit or handbook ( well she was registered in 1988 ! lol ) Outfit situated on the Wirral and as insured until 23rd April I'd like a sale before then to save renewing the insurance etc. Could obviously deliver (at cost) within a reasonable distance. Photos not the best but simply pushed her out to take the photos Reduced priced for quick sale. Sorry but No offers.</description>

        <description>For Sale is an AJS DD125E Raptor with Mot till September, got this bike for my daughter to upgrade too from her SR125, but she prefers her Yamaha. This bike starts on the button but will need the carb sorting before being ridden as she has been standing for over three months, everything else works as it should, and will make a wonderful first bike, I had one of these before I passed my test and I loved it. have full logbook and 2 keys. for more information please contact me. £550 ONO, will accept sensible offers. Thanks for looking.</description>

        <description>1992 J reg triumph trophy 4 1200cc, 46,000 miles , Comes with hard side panniers and rack Purchased in February as a none running project, all the mechanical work has been done and it passed the MOT in March so has 11 months remaining Needs slight cosmetic work and TLC, it needs a replacement screen (due to previous owner breaking it trying to remove it when we collected it) , these are on eBay for about £20-£30 Seat needs recovering It sometimes misfires when it gets warm so will probably need right side coil replacing (left side has already been replaced) It has a new pick up coil, new leads,caps and plugs, good metzler tyres, reconditioned rear suspension, new radiator and fan , clutch and gearbox are smooth in every gear and all electrics work as they should. This is an old school sports tourer and pulls extremely good as well as sounding nice. Bike is based in Bilston. West Midlands</description>

        <description>Vespa PX125E Barnfind scooter. Runs well, gears &amp; brakes work. Can be ridden but needs MOT. This is a Y reg scooter registered in England in 2001 and originally manufactured in 1983 so really it's an 80's model. It has a new yankee style seat fitted as the old seat was torn. This was a barn find and still needs a bit of tidying but can be used as it is. I've got the V5 logbook and keys I'm asking £995 or sensible offer but it will have to be close. I won't be answering any stupid offers.</description>

        <description>£1699 +OTR KYMCO AGILITY RS 125 - The Agility RS 125 has been designed to stand out from the crowd. With a bold, sports design this scooter has massive street appeal and road presence at an unbeatable price. Sporty Looks and High Performance at an Affordable Price The RS 125 boasts a top speed of 65mph. Agile and quick with a bold sporty design, this high performance scooter has massive street appeal and road presence at an unbeatable price, offering riders fantastic value for money. The RS 125 is quick off the mark and with a net weight of just 107kg it is light, agile and therefore ultra easy to handle and park. Edgy graphic panels, sleek lines, a sports instrumentation panel, 12" alloy wheels and striking white/black paintwork all combine to reinforce the impressive sports styling. Fuel Efficient and Environmentally Friendly This superb high performance scooter is powered by the latest generation of 4 stroke air-cooled engines, which ultimately makes it greener and more fuel-efficient. Capable of achieving in excess of 100 miles per gallon as well as producing very low carbon emissions, it is extremely efficient to run.

Pillions are well catered for, with a spacious seat and grab rail, so you can share your journey with a friend if the mood takes you. Other features include: electric and kick-start, automatic choke, lockable under seat storage box for helmet, shopping or waterproofs, steering lock, rear carrier, centre and side stands. 2-Year Warranty The RS 125 comes with a 2-year unlimited mileage manufacturer's warranty.</description>

Nothing wrong with it just selling as I just bought a car , has a DEP3 exhaust on it. It has had its second service done at 2500miles, been looked after with care and stored away at night. Looking for around 2200 but can take lower offer if reasonable.</description>

        <description>2002 Yamaha Fazer 600cc (FZS 600) Just turned 30k miles MOT'd to August 2016 &amp; taxed Makes an excellent first bike if you've just passed your direct access test - more powerful than a 600 Bandit and the half fairing gives decent wind protection. I've owned the bike for just over a year and I've covered 7k miles in that time. The bike hasn't missed a beat. Braided brake lines tinted screen Rear hugger Belly pan Raven exhaust can 2 sets of keys Original tool kit is still in place under the seat Comes with standard seat and lowered seat Always stored in my garage Last serviced in August (oil, filter and spark plugs) and the bike had new tyres (Bridgestone T30 Evo) fitted just before this. I've added a Givi Monorack and 46L Givi Top Box, which come with the bike. I've also added a louder horn than standard. Bike has a few age related marks (eg. a few bits of paint have flaked off the mirror stalks), but in general, the bike is in good condition for it's age. Bike is running very well and starts easily, even on cold mornings. Selling as I want to move up to a bigger adventure touring bike. Would consider a P/X (cash your way) for a R1150GS/Tiger/Multistrada/Varadero/V-Strom/Versys or similar. ** UPDATE: I had the bike out a run today (Sunday) and it looks like one of the fork seals has went. I'm hoping to get it fixed this week, but I have reduced the price of the bike by £100 in case someone wants to buy it as-is. I will put the price back up when I have had the fork seals replaced. Thanks **</description>

        <description>2006 Suzuki bandit 650s an abs model and last of the carbs, I took this bike in px, it's an ideal street fighter project, or could be mot'd as it is. Comes with service history and other documents. It's a high mileage bike at 60,000 but previous owner changed engine to a 30,000 mile engine, but I have no proof of this. But these engines are strong commuters and have a good life span. The engine runs sweet, wouldn't take much to tidy up. Throttle cables could do with a setup, it currently has no chain or mot. But has all gears, wheel bearings seem ok. Overall bike is complete. Comes with mirrors. These bikes still fetch good money when mot'd and tidy. Grab a bargain £650 Ono</description>

        <description>Hello, here for sale is my Aprilia rs 50. I have had this motorbike for a year now and due to turning 17 I am looking to upgrade to a 125cc. It is an excellent geared 50cc ideal for any learner who likes a good looking, fast 50cc. It has recently had alot of work done to it; Brand new 80cc Malossi Big Bore kit, Brand new 21mm Dellorto carb kit, Rebuilt bottom end (new crankshaft), New Clutch and clutch lever fitted, New Gear change lever and Brand new chain and sprocket just fitted, New front and rear sprocket to give more top end, New rear indicator, New, genuine Aprilia starter motor, New battery, New side stand, New oil tank, New fuel sensor/tap, New rear tyre, New spark plugs and coolant, All the above parts have all been professionally fitted and I have receipts that can be supplied if requested. over the past few month I have spent into the thousands to get this rs 50 back to a near new condition mechanically. It has always been run on high quality low smoke 2 stroke oil. As it has recently had a new top end fitted it needs to be run in, after it has been run in it should do between 60-70 mph. Anyone who loves fast 50cc motorbikes and wants a great feeling bike the rs 50 is perfect. Runs smoothly and starts first time on the button. Fairings are in fair condition and show some age related marks, as seen in picture they cannot be noticed easily. 12 Months MOT and currently taxed. Comes with some extras; Original 50cc engine still fully functioning and original Carburetor, spare set of brake pads, power box, spare gear lever. Mileage on clock shows at 16915, However due to it having a new top end it really has 0 miles on it. Any questions please feel free to message me, £1550 ONO</description>

        <description>£2199 +OTR KYMCO PEOPLE ONE 125I - The all new People One 125i has been designed with the style conscious commuter in mind. With a comfortable lower seat height of 760mm and larger diameter wheels, plus a 4-stroke, direct fuel injection, 2-valve engine, the People One 125i is sure to exceed expectations. Big wheels are all the rage in Europe and especially in Italy, a market KYMCO continues to dominate, because for novice riders and city commuters they provide extra stability and are subsequently easier to handle, manoeuvre and park. Here in the UK, KYMCO has seen this sector of the market flourish over the last 12-18 months with the big-wheeled City 125 scooter being one of its best sellers in 2012/13. The arrival of the People One 125i extends this opportunity by offering commuters an Italian styled, fuel injected machine, at a price that rivals all others in its class. The People One 125i also comes fully equipped with a host of premium features as standard, including adjustable rear suspension, halogen headlight, spoked alloy wheels and a colour-matched rear top box. It also has a lockable glove box, and an under seat storage compartment that is large enough to store an open-faced helmet. The bright and colourful display ensures that the speedometer, fuel gauge and clock are easy to read at a glance. The People One 125i is now available from all KYMCO recognised dealers in a fashionable Pearlescent White with contrasting black trim &amp; features. This superb new scooter also benefits from KYMCO’s 2-year unlimited-mileage manufacturer’s parts and labour warranty.</description>

        <description>1640 miles year : 2015 I will also give a safety chain and a disc lock to a buyer It's a great bike, easy to ride and very light compared to other 125s. Great for a learner, especially if it's your first bike. It is fairly new on the market but you can read some reviews on it online, all of them very positive. I didn't have any problems with it, it is my first bike and if I had to buy again this is exactly the one I'd get</description>

        <description>The classic Triumph long distance sport tourer, it has the legendary triple 955i engine which produces torque everywhere making for a relaxed easy ride. The Sprint ST's have a very large fuel tank giving a range well in excess of 200 miles and is perfect for long distance work. I have done a 4k European trip on one of theses bikes and they are close to perfect, the chassis is sharp and predictable, the engine strong, the four pot brakes outstanding and is all day comfortable.The bad points are that the nose cone has had a knock and been resprayed and a the side fairing has a small crack (see the photographs). The bike rides perfectly and feels strong, the gears are good and all ancillaries in good condition. come and have a look.

        <description>A fantastic looking Vespa LX 125. Lots of additional features - neon lights on the under carriage, multi changing colours, Vespa bike cover, sturdy lock, Union Jack seat cover, top box, 2 x flags that fix to the top box, front spinning wheel trim, and if you like I can throw in the helmet and jacket at a small fee. I have hardly ridden this scooter as I got pregnant with twins shortly after purchase. 1 previous owner before me and that lady sold it as she had a damaged wrist. No gears just a pull and go and it certainly does go. An attractive bike which certainly is a head turner. 1111 miles on the clock and I recently purchased a new battery as I haven't ridden it for over 2 years! I'm very reluctant to sell as it is a beauty, but I'm not going to get the use out of it really. I'm more than happy for you to come and take a look.</description>

        <description>I am selling my Gilera Sc125, it is a 2 stroke 125 and very quick for a small bike. It looks and feels like a big bike. It has had a bit of work done to it, all by a reputable garage - of which recipes can be provided. Milage is around 11,000 and may increase as the bike is still in use. some fairings are scratched and currently the indicator lens is broken, but i am getting that done. MOT is until August. I am only selling this bike as I am relocating, otherwise I would love to of kept it! Any Questions, feel free to call or text 07875501947</description>

        <description>Cracking little scooter in great condition, most scooters in this price range have been owned by teenagers and thrashed but the previous owner of this scooter was an old chap who used it for the commute to work and since buying it off him I haven't used it due to changing jobs and not needing it so it's been sat in my garage for 5 months untouched and unloved. Cheap to tax and insure, just needs its first MOT and it's ready to ride.</description>

        <description>Sadly Selling my FZR1000 EXUP as i am getting a new bike, and need the space. Its a good bike, with low miles, and has a full years M.O.T (14/4/16) Its had a brand new battery and plugs just fitted, as well as having the carbs stripped and cleaned! Its also fitted with a mega expensive Ohlin rear shock (approx £1000) It has a polished frame and wheel rims. It also has braided hoses front and rear, and a Carbon can on it which sounds really nice, without upsetting the neighbors or M.O.T tester! Other than these few sensible mods,Its a standard bike. These are fast bikes, and are becoming very collectable. Just read some of the reviews! No dreamers please....</description>

        <description>Kawasaki z440 ltd This bike runs and rides, has MOT and tax, but I'm selling as a project as there are a couple of jobs to do to make perfect. Since having the bike I've put new carb rubbers on, rebuilt the carbs with all new jets, new coil, HT leads, plugs, plug caps, battery. It ran on one cylinder when I bought it due to a duff float needle but thought I might as well go overboard once I had the cars off - Runs on two now, obviously! Has belt drive (factory) I've put lower handlebars on instead of the silly buckhorns (though you're welcome to them if you like) New master cylinder, headlight and throttle cable. Private plate included "B300MBJ" Quite like that it says BOOM in the middle Like I say, runs and rides, but please consider it a project. It's not perfect, the exhaust has been painted (badly, if I'm honest). I can throw in some bar end indicators I was going to fit. I've ridden it about locally but I'd recommend collecting in a van or trailer. Oh, this is the full power 40bhp model, not the rubbish 29bhp the Germans got. It would make a brilliant bobber/cafe project, that's what I was going to do, but I've bought an old Triumph to tinker with, and 2 project bikes is a bit too many.</description>

The Downtown 300i combines high performance with luxurious styling and leads the way in terms of comfort, security and safety. Sports-Tourer Scooter The Downtown 300i has been engineered and aesthetically designed to deliver maximum technological performance and comfort. At the heart of the machine is KYMCO's new liquid cooled four-stroke, four valve, single cylinder, fuel injection engine, which has served to significantly enhance the machine's performance, and give the scooter a genuine 299cc capacity that can achieve a top speed of 90mph with a powerful 29.5bhp at 8000rpm. These impressive statistics will rival all other scooters in the same class, and are why it has proved to be a top seller in mainland Europe &amp; America. Stylish and Practical for City and Leisure Riders The Downtown 300i has a high quality sports look that is both stylish and practical. The modern styling is the work of Italian designer' Massimo Zaniboni, and every detail from the 'eagle-eyed' twin headlights, to the elegant instrument panel, the 12v phone charger, the design of the air inlets on the body and the large under seat storage that can hold up to two helmets, has been carefully considered to ensure that it can satisfy the needs of both city and leisure riders worldwide. Designed for Comfort, Safety and Security The Downtown 300i benefits from additional technical enhancements, including ABS brakes, a new transmission and ignition system with a high performance chassis, which KYMCO has designed to increase tension and provide a safer ride, a twin balance shaft that reduces engine vibration and improves rider comfort, and a redesigned CVT transmission system to enhance shift efficiency. For added stability, the robust chassis also features generously sized wheels (14-inch at the front and 13-inch at the rear).

        <description>Here we have an immaculate example of the R1. New tyres have been fitted to the bike so no need to change them for a while! Top spec engine protectors have been fitted just in case the worst should happen. Fitted with a double bubble screen for an extra bit of wind protection. The bike comes with a factory fit immobilizer, this stops a cloned key or screw driver being used to start the bike. The bike comes with all original keys and manuals as were supplied new. Being Fitted with Adjustable Brake and Clutch levers enables the rider to set up the bike as they want it. The bike has also been fitted with a performance exhaust, this allows a little more of a growl upon acceleration and also allows the throttle to be a lot more responsive. The bike has been fitted with braided brake hoses, this means there is no room for expansion as you get with rubber hoses giving much better braking efficiency. The bike is also fitted with LED Indicators, these not only look fantastic but give a brighter more visible illumination. The bike has been HPI checked and a Certificate will be presented with the bike. The paintwork has no chips, scratches or dents and has been fully polished by our on-site valet. Viewing is welcome any time and we guarantee you won’t be disappointed. We also offer nationwide delivery, so if you prefer us to bring the bike to you just let us know!

        <description>This is a brand new never ridden, not registered LML Vespa 150cc 4 speed manual two stroke scooter. In cream and in showroom condition, with two sets of keys and a VIN dating letter. It was one of several used as a display prop within a certain very well known high street store, across the country. For display health and safety purposes, the engine, fuel tank and half the electrics were removed. I have now acquired this scooter (Without engine)and have just bought the electric loom and other bits. Use this scooter to replace your rotted frame, or just bolt your engine in(DVLA require date of manufacture, 2012, an MOT and Insurance which can be done on the frame number..give to DVLA and the will issue an age related number plate or use your V5 details) So why am I selling, because I have just bought a Lambretta, and along with my other LML Vespa 200cc I do not have the room. Any inspection welcome, even if you didnt rebuild this scooter it would be perfect doner for any Vespa PX PE rebuild, just put YOUR engine, transfer your frame numbers and there you go. Or break it, the front end alone is worth around £400, sell the empty engine crank case (which from the numbers is a 1971 Vespa 125 GT)and theres another couple of hundred. I dont have the time or the space, or being arsed to rebuild or break so someone is going to get a serious bargain. Asking £950 Any inspection welcome</description>

        <description>Here I have my Honda Cbf 125. The bike has only 7000 miles on it which is very low for the price of the bike, the miles will go up as I use it to commute to work every day and back but that's only about 10 miles a day so shouldn't make much of a difference, the bike has been serviced regularly (every 900 miles), I've recently changed the chain and sprockets and have had new indicators fitted, I have one spare brand new indicator left which can be taken with the bike, I also have the bikes original manual. I have the logbook in my name, the bike has MOT till 9th August 2016 And has road tax on it. Lovely bike, rides smoothly, I have 2 keys, a spare helmet and a motorcycle lock that I will give with the bike. I really don't want to sell it as it is a great bike but I'm looking to buy a car, it's very cheap on petrol and it is quick and nippy. it has a few age related marks and some damage of when the bike was dropped which I have put pictures off, the bike was dropped by the last owner, and has not been dropped by me since I have bought it. When the bike was dropped the break leaver had slightly snapped, I have never had any problems with it when I have used it and once again that is very easy to replace. The relay needs to be changed which should be very cheap to do and the left indicators need to be wired properly again which is very easy to do. other then that the bike is in good condition. The bike is sold as seen, I am not really wiling to go down but will except a reasonable offer. The bike is a bargain for the price as it is. Also like I said there is nothing wrong mechanically or engine wise but there is a slight bit of wear and tear. Part exchange for a car or cash, Any inquiries phone me on 07908659260</description>

        <description>Very good condition, Triumph dealer supplied pannier set with fixing frame and luggage brackets. Included is an extra key barrel for a back box. This key fits all Locks which are Triumph supplied. I had it cut and does not have a transponder. One small ding in lower area of near side pannier and very minimal wear elsewhere. They are off my 2012 Tiger 800 and fit 2010 - 2014 model. Now surplus to my requirements. Ideally they are uplift only but I am prepared to deliver up to 30 miles for £20 or meet within that range. If you want to fit them to your bike here, you can use my garage to do so after cash is exchanged. I don't want to get involved with posting due to their bulk. Might have to be quick as a couple of sets have sold on eBay recently for around £400 plus post. The washers in the photo of the frame are not included but long bolts are. These should be on your bike already</description>

        <description>£4999 +OTR KYMCO XCITING 400I ABS - Already a big hit in Europe and the USA, the Xciting 400i is credited for offering a highly technical specification and a new generation of safety features for improved handling and comfort. Technically, the Xciting 400i’s features will appeal to bike aficionados wanting a quality alternative to mid-sized commuter motorcycles. For safety, KYMCO has developed a dual under-bone design for the Xciting 400i frame to reduce vibration and improve handling, supported by 5-stage adjustable rear suspension and a new floating disc brake system with radial mounted calipers – a system developed by KYMCO from bigger bike designs.This is further strengthened with the inclusion of BOSCH ABS, and makes the Xciting 400i the only scooter in its class and price range (including those with a higher RRP) that comes with ABS as standard. The low seat height (795mm), relatively low dry weight (200Kg) and ergonomic riding position add to the scooter’s safe and easy handling. Power-wise, KYMCO’s brand new liquid cooled, 4 valve, 399cc EFI engine gives the Xciting 400i an impressive output of 26.5kW / 7500rpm, with a top speed of 95mph. These range-topping figures make the Xciting 400i more than capable of coping with traffic flow on congested roads and motorways.

        <description>CBR 250R (ABS) in great condition, Full service history, 10,700miles. Recently serviced and MOT'd, and fitted with a new chain and sprocket kit.

Lots of extras including oxford heated grips for the winter, top box and lowering kit (not currently fitted) imported from the USA worth over £100.

Perfect for those who are looking to "step up" from a 125cc, or someone who is looking for a sports bike that is very efficient on fuel, yet has speeds capable of over 100mph. Viewings available at evenings or weekends, or can offer free delivery to the Southampton area. Serious buyers only please, will not ship outside UK. Relisted due to timewasters Any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks.</description>

MOT has just ran out but will fly through it, I would MOT it myself but don't want to tax and insure it just for a MOT. Tyres are borderline legal might get 200 miles out of them or so. Small crack on the nose cone paint see pics. I have the standard exhaust for it and 2 sets of keys. Any questions just ask.</description>

        <description>I've had this bike for 4 years and used it for dry weather fun,although its high milage it's been dealer serviced upto 63000 miles and the engine sounds great .In these 4 years I've done mixed riding solo and 2up and found the bike very capable,cheap to insure very good miles per gal.I had 1 issue with blocked tank breathers ,which I fixed with the help of Haynes,the oil has been changed once a year (I've done about 1000/year)It has triumph hand and service book ,tool kit and 2 keys(and Haynes book)MOT is only until 4/5/16 but I think it should sail through.</description>

        <description>CK1 125 - KYMCO has responded to the demands for stylish economical transport by launching the impressive CK1 125cc Naked Sports motorcycle - priced at just £1999. The first thing that stands out on the CK1 125 is the bike’s sharp &amp; modern styling, and it’s this edgy ‘street bike’ look that KYMCO say will attract the attention of younger riders looking for an alternative to the traditional style of learner-legal commuter bike. With KYMCO’s new ultra efficient 4-stroke air cooled OHC 125cc engine, the CK1 is also impressively cheap to run, making it one of the most affordable 125 commuter bikes on the market. With a comfortable top speed of 65mph, the CK1 can achieve well in excess of 100 miles per gallon. That means based on average petrol prices, £10 worth of fuel could, in theory, cover more than 160 miles. Combine this with KYMCO’s finance package, which is available from just £50 per month*, and not forgetting you can ride a 125 on L-plates, the CK1 is not only a stylish proposition for young learners, it’s also a very affordable one for more mature riders too. In your local dealer now, the CK1 125 is available three exciting colours - Flame Orange Metallic, Oyster Gold Metallic or Bright Green Metallic, priced at only £1999 with a 2-year unlimited-mileage manufacturer’s warranty.</description>

        <description>A little Honda SS50, purchased to carry out a restoration on, however I have come to the conclusion that I have so much on with other projects. Frame is solid, original seat, tank, engine. Engine numbers are in the correct series for the frame. Engine turns over nicely. Carb looks clean. Obviously a few components missing A reluctant sale as I wanted to keep this little beauty to restore! No V5C I am afraid, but both engine and frame numbers are clear and untampered with. Thanks,</description>

        <description>I am toying with the idea of swapping my rf 600 for something else as I fancy a change it is in great conditon condition for age it has only done 20 odd thousand miles with paper work to back this up it has brand new tyres fitted today and the oil and filter has just been changed and comes with original wallet and nearly all the paper work it also comes with original clear screen aswell as the tinted screen I would quite fancy a zxr or cbr but what have you got that is over 600cc I have probably missed loads out so just ask me if you want to know anything thanks.</description>

        <description>Here we have my Kawasaki ZX6R in mint condition and very well looked after. I have had this bike since 2011 and it has been a brilliant bike never let me down starts first time every time. I have all MOTs since I have had the bike to show it has passed first time every time. I have just put her through a MOT (feb) and passed first time so comes with a long MOT. I have had the bike re-sprayed last year the new Kawasaki green this was done by a professional company and was not a spray can job! I currently have a black visor on the bike but do have the original clear one which will come with the bike. I am only selling due to no longer having the time and it is a shame to leave her locked up in the garage. V5 is present. Any questions or to view please feel free to contact me.</description>

        <description>KTM 250 EXC 51 Plate road registered with 12 months MOT as of 9th April. £1900 ONO Flew through its MOT with no advisories. Excellent Enduro bike with plenty of torque for woods riding or green laning. Just last year I stripped the bike and gave it a top and bottom end rebuild with a full set of gaskets and oil seals. Squish is perfect and it has load of compression. Also whilst this was being done I replaced the rear wheel bearings and rear tyre. You can see by the tread left on the rear tyre that I've done virtually no miles on it since. Also replaced front tyre last week in preparation for its MOT as previous tyre was not road legal. Please note, to all younger viewers, this bike is registered as a 250cc so you will not be able to ride it on the road legally if you only have a CBT. I will accept reasonable offers but I am more than happy to keep the bike another year or two if I don't get what I'm looking for. Please contact me if you require any more info.

Original handbook and service book etc. 7 previous owners Extras include: Large top box, touring screen (original fitted at the moment) center stand (I think this was optional when new but I might be wrong!), and crash bars Someone has obviously looked after the bike very well as it has been Data Tagged all over the chassis etc. I have the document to back this up as well. I'm sure I've missed something so please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have or to view. bike is in Bromley SE London Collection only Cash on collection</description>

        <description>£1699 +OTR This new and improved model has a sleek &amp; stylish design, with a Jet Black or Diamond Red gloss finish. With features such as an analogue rev counter, illuminated gear display, electric and kick start, a generous fuel tank capacity of 16 litres, a light net weight of just 115kg for great manoeuvrability and a relatively low seating position. KYMCO'S NEW PULSAR 'S' GIVES EVEN MORE The all-new Pulsar 'S' 125 replaces the existing Pulsar Naked and LX models and comes with much sharper styling and an improved technical specification, to offer even more value for money Since the Pulsar 125 first launched in 2003 it has been providing riders of all ages with an affordable and economical mode of transport, and the new Pulsar S promises to give even more. It is powered by KYMCO's latest fuel efficient 4-stroke air cooled engine, which has a top speed of 65mph and can achieve in excess of 100 miles to the gallon. Not only that, but this model produces the lowest CO2 emissions in its class, at just 0.83g/km. KYMCO has also added gas assisted rear suspension to the latest spec to further improve rider comfort and cornering stability. KYMCO who have a rich heritage in manufacturing for brands like Honda, Kawasaki &amp; latterly BMW, state that the Pulsar S is one of the best equipped bikes in its price band. Plus, it comes with a trusted 2-year unlimited mileage parts and labour manufacturers' warranty. The Pulsar S is stylish too, as it comes with sleek gloss paintwork, in either Diamond Red or Jet Black, with painted 5-spoke alloy wheels fitted as standard. Additional features include; electric and kick start, digital odometer, illuminated gear indicator, rear carrier rack, steering lock and side and centre stands.</description>

        <description>Bit if a curio this one. A 1938 BMW R 71 built by the Chinese using BMW tooling supplied by the Russians after the war. No MOT or Tax required as it's registered before 1960, so cheap to run. Iv'e had it for a few years now and feel it's time for a change. Deep finned sump fitted for better cooling. Solo gearing. Reverse gear. 12v electrics. Some spares. Leather panniers and pillion seat. Remember, this is 1930's engineering so will require the new owner to be a bit handy spannering. Having said that, it's never let me down in 5 years.</description>

        <description>This is my beautiful, low mileage, Yamaha Dragstar and it’s possibly the cheapest on Gumtree? Considered by many to be the best and most desirable learner legal cruiser. It's a proper bike with a proper engine and is highly sought after. Although it's a large bike, the seat height is low making it easy and stable to ride. Thanks to its large V-twin engine it doesn't look or sound like a 125 with the twin exhausts emitting a throaty rubble. . It certainly looks the part, and turns heads everywhere she goes, with lots of shiny bits and great street cred. Recent full service including a new battery. Good, low mileage Dragstar’s are becoming rare and collectable, hence values are rising. Starts on the button and runs like a dream. The chrome work is in great condition and overall it would put many bikes half its age to shame. MOT’d until the 30th July. MOT history, servicing invoices and 2 keys present. The pillion seat fitted, but can easily be removed in minutes, if you prefer the single seat look. So why a ride a flimsy scooter that sounds like an angry wasp, when you can stand out from the crowd and have this? Priced for a quick sale. Polite request, please no more time wasters or stupid offers, plus NO I won't swap it for your knackered car or pregnant girlfriend!</description>

        <description>I bought this bike in 2011 February.. I haven't got much use out of it in the last two years and the mileage shows this.. I've recently had it motd april 2016 where it went straight through with some advice on the chain needing to be tightened and front brake calibers adjusting, cleaning.. it's in great condition and the reason for lack of use, is its current storage situation away from my home address.. It last had a full belt ducati brislington service 2 years ago exactly, so would be due a service at some time, but since it's last full service it has mostly been garaged.. in the years before i had the medium service and when i purchased the bike from ducati Brislington, it had pretty much a rebulid before i bought as the bottom bearing needed doing, and was like id bought a new engine after.. i can't fault it for reliability which is something to be said for these bikes sometimes... it really has been great when I've got out on it and it will be a disappointment to get rid of it.. I can at somepoint get its history printed from ducati where I've had all the work completed, but for the money Im asking and the condition this is a really good buy.... termingoni racing Exahust fitted with a beautiful sound, and original to accompany, bike alarm fitted also...</description>

        <description>Hi for sale is my 2003 Aprilia Falco which has just turned 10,000 miles on it today.Bike is immaculate as can be seen in photos,it comes with Aprilia Falco Fighter exhaust system which sounds awesome and cost nearly 1200 pounds ,oil&amp;filter just changed and new chain &amp;sprocket kit about 500 miles ago.This bike has wanted for nothing and has only one previous owner who treated it like a baby with heater and blanket over bike.Bike was bought out of Jeremy MCwilliams shop and i purchased it just over a year ago with 7500 miles on it .This bike is full of torque and pulls like a train and having never owned a v twin before i was really surprised.I also have the original exhausts and rear seat which will go with the bike,only reason im selling is that i have just bought another bike and dont have room for them both.No swaps and no tyre kickers please £2650 ovno</description>

        <description>Hi there for sale only due to myself and my wife getting divorced is my beloved Kawasaki 636 which can only be described as as new condition and is polished more than its used. This bike has been garaged it whole life and only ever had dry summer use. It will have a years mot for the buyer and is lucky if it has even covered 100 miles since its last at the same time I replaced all filters and oil, upgraded the brake fluid and fitted a new front and rear Michelin pilot power. I have owned this bike 24/05/2011 and never had any problems whatsoever it also had a new battery fitted and is keep on a constant trickle charge in my garage as the alarm immobiliser drains it otherwise, I have two keys and two remotes for the alarm and all necessary paperwork and also it's full tool kit and original exhaust will also come with it as well as the micron . I am so upset I am having to part with this as it really is a joy to own but as previously stated its out with my hands.this truly is a complete one off example you will not find a cleaner one first to see will buy any questions give me a call cheers.</description>

Alot of attention to detail. overall bike looks show quality and not many finer examples. Couple minor stone chips on front but not really noticeable, and small crack on left side fairing beside choke size of yr small finger nail.see pic. All original bits with bike, original owners manual and spare key few old mot's etc. Any more info call or email no agencies wanting me to email u won't be replying £2500 ono</description>

        <description>One owner before myself, nice little runner. MOT due mid-May. Some slight issues which can be easily fixed, but durable. Could be used for deliveries or short journeys. Collection only from the Harrogate area. Includes a helmet /luggage box already mounted on rear. Bought as a bargain last year, but not currently in use. Last usage: end of April. Has a yellow smiley sticker on front from previous owner. Answers to the name of "The Geeb". Will require a bit of care, as I have no knowledge of scooter maintenance. Could be either a good project for a hobbyist or could just be used as Parts Includes all paperwork, user manual and documemts. Ask for Ollie.</description>

With only 4280 miles (the clock reads Km). The engine is as sweet as. This was my daughter's bike so if it even hinted at needing something it got it. A new set of tyres have been fitted, not that the originals were worn but simply because they were old and hard. Likewise the brake pads. The rear shock has also been replaced as it began to leak a little. Coolant and gear oil just changed. Also fitted are 30mm handlebar risers Heated Grips, Red Renthal style braced MX bars with matching flush bar ends Highsider Mirrors. This is an exceptionally good example and is sold with warranty.

        <description>2001 Honda Fireblade 929 I have owned this bike 3 years now and only covered about 3000 sunny miles. Due to lack of use I have decided to sell. I bought this bike from a local Honda dealer with full service history stamped up in the service book, the last being at just under 18,000 miles. Since this date I have serviced it annually changing the oil, all filters and refreshed brake fluids etc. The bike is very clean, never put away dirty after a ride, never ridden on salty roads or the wet so no rust present. Upgrades I have added are short adjustable brake and clutch levers as the original clutch was not adjustable for span, the aftermarket indicators were fitted before I purchased the bike and suit it great and also I have put on a Viper silencer which sounds great but not too loud or unsociable. Original is included. For this season I have put on a new sealed gel battery and the bike just flew through an MOT with no advisories so is definitely ready to be ridden and enjoyed this summer. There is a mark in the tank which was there when I bought it but after looking at other bikes at the time the overall condition of this Blade was better than other available bikes. Other age related marks but overall great condition. V5 present in my name, current and old MOTs and service book present. £2,500 ono Viewings welcome. Cash on collection. No warranties implied. Advertised elsewhere so may remove advert. Any questions please call Chris on 07742295741.</description>

        <description>For sale is my beloved CBR400RR NC29. It is a 1991, imported 1993. 28k KILOMETRES on the clock. Bike has been very very well looked after with a list of upgrades: Repsol race fairing kit FULL stainless exhaust system HRC Ignitech CDI (With dyno port) HRC Rim tape Honda race filler cap Powder coated wheels and tank HEL colour coded brake lines all round Refurbished brake calipers all round Rear hugger Gold probolt kit Gold swingarm bobbins Gold CNC levers Gold top yoke nut Gold brake reservoir cap Talon gold rear sprocket with anodised sprocket nuts Carbon fibre effect Yoshimura rep end can (Very loud, baffle included) Carbon fibre chain guard Carbon fibre effect mirrors Carbon fibre fork guards Carbon fibre TYGA clock surround Carbon fibre effect indicators front and rear CBR engraved bar ends LED tail unit (Looks amazing) Original FOLDING pillion footpegs - hard to find now. Electrex stator coil fitted 150 miles ago Electrex R6 regulator fitted 150 miles ago Upgraded SHOWA suspension fully adjustable No expense spared on this bike, pictures will not do it justice. Only bad points are the low beam switch, seems like a loose connection inside the switch, so the high beam is usually kept on for this reason. Unit could either be fixed or replaced.. And the famous fireblade 'boot' doesn't require a key to open. (It can be opened by pushing a toggle where the key hole should be) This is an almost showroom condition bike for its age, and is a great example of the sought after NC29. 62.6BHP readout, so can be used on an A2 license if needed.

        <description>Stand out from the crowd with this Harley look-a-like motorbike. Cruiser style with low slung seat makes it easy to put your feet on the ground and is ideal for a learner. MOT expiry date is 7 April 2017. There were no advisories. 125cc twin cylinder with twin exhaust. The bike looks fantastic with gloss black and silver paintwork. Flame effect on front and rear mudguards. All chrome work is in very good condition for age. It has a remote controlled alarm and immobiliser fitted. Steering lock. There are 2 sets of keys and 2 remotes. 3 previous owners. I bought it in December 2010. 4237 miles. I believe the mileage is genuine and have no reason to doubt otherwise. Please ask if you have any other questions.</description>

        <description>For sale is my Kawasaki z700. £600 ono The bike is an import and UK registered in 1995. The actual Year of manufacture is 1985. The bike ran out of MOT in February or January. I sell it as spairs or repair. Its a runner but the chain tensioner needs replacing, carburettor adjusting, right hand mirror is cracked and the oil pan needs replacing too as the sump plug got cross threaded and is leaking. I bought the bike last year as an easy project but have no use for it anymore and want to move on to something better, faster and newer anyway. The bike comes with 3 different size of number plates small, medium and legal. A supertrap exhaust is fitted and the exhaust next to the machine on the photo does not come with it. 64000mile on the clock and wear and tear on several parts as you would expect from a 30year old bike. Any questions please let me know. What you see is what you get, I haven't got the means of delivering so the winning bidder will have to pick the bike up after purchase. If you would like to view it let me know. Cash on collection only</description>

        <description>VERY LOW MILES!!! Electric start. Metallic Red. Immaculate Condition. 2 owners This bike was owned by my elderly neighbour Who used it only to go to the local shops and back.I acquired it three years ago hoping to maybe one day do my test. But Have finally come to realise that it's not going to happen any time soon and I really could do with the garage space. The bike hasn't been ridden since 2011 and therefore needs an MOT also the indicators aren't working which is probably just the relay. I would have got this done but with no means of getting the bike to a local garage I will just have to sell it as it is. The bike has the old stone chip and a light scuff on the front mudguard but you can hardly notice it, otherwise it is in fantastic condition as you expect from such a low mileage example. Any questions please call 07795 007171 Thanks for looking</description>

        <description>For sale is my suzuki en 125 2006 model with 12 months mot. just been serviced last week before the mot 07.04.2016. New oil and filter Fuel filter changed. Runs really nice very low mileage due to it being parked up for 5 years. Two owners from new. Bike is very economical up to 100 mpg. Only bad bit is the paint has flaked off the tank so it looks a bit tatty. Otherwise bike is sound. Ideal for new riders as its got a gear selector indicator. Its a very cheap commuter due to its high mpg. Tax is £17 year so won't break the bank. The mileage is 8k. Get yourself a summer bargain.</description>

        <description>For sale is my suzuki en 125 2006 model with 12 months mot. just been serviced last week before the mot 07.04.2016. New oil and filter Fuel filter changed. Runs really nice very low mileage due to it being parked up for 5 years. Two owners from new. Bike is very economical up to 100 mpg. Only bad bit is the paint has flaked off the tank so it looks a bit tatty. Otherwise bike is sound. Ideal for new riders as its got a gear selector indicator. Its a very cheap commuter due to its high mpg. Tax is £17 year so won't break the bank. The mileage is 8k. Get yourself a summer bargain.</description>

        <description>Kawasaki Z650 1978 34 000 miles Refurbished to good standard. £1500 + spent over 6 years. Done less than 100 miles since engine work consisting of new rings,valve seals,cam chain,primary chain,clutch,starter clutch. Modified with electronic tacho and ignition on side. Renthal bars. Was on the road last year but the MOT has expired. Starts easily and runs fairly quiet with no smoke considering the bike is 38 years old ! Bike has had frame powder coated and parts professionally resprayed. If this bike was original it would be going for £2500-£3000 at least. Priced much lower because of the modifications. I am aware that the bike will appeal to less people because of this. I do have the original controls, tacho,front mudguard and rear shocks. Although not original it is still a real head turner and always gets people talking to me if i take a run to any of the local biker hangouts.</description>

        <description>Don't miss this rare opportunity to grab yourself a piece of true motoring heritage. It is a 1992 23 year old Honda CB750 F2 which unbelievably is still in immaculate original condition. This has not been restored. It is 100% original and I'm led to believe has never yet seen any rain which looking at the condition of it could be believable. Seriously you could roll it back into the showroom. It boasts only 2 owners from new, comes with full service history, 2 sets of keys, every MOT, tax disc and original owners manual. It has covered just over 26,000 miles and if the sun shines this will increase! This may not be a classic yet but it is most certainly very retro and will only increase in value if kept in this condition. It will come with a new 12 months MOT and it starts, runs and rides beautifully. It is a pleasure to own and a joy to ride. Messers and time wasters will not be tolerated. This is a spectacular machine. Any trial or inspection is welcome. Please do not hesitate to contact me on 01454 279240 or 07917 224495. £2795</description>

        <description>BMW K100 RS 16 valve. ABS model. 1990. 28,700 miles. MOT until 8th April 2017. Metallic green. The bike has only done 500 miles since last MOT, which is my reason for selling. Currently on 'sorn'. I have owned this bike for 10 years and am its third owner. It had done 16,000 miles when I bought it. The bike has been garaged, kept on a trickle-charger and used for dry Sunday runs (spring to autumn) and several summer trips to France. Over recent years it has had: a new master cylinder, new head bearings, front fork oil changed, drive shaft replaced, new battery and a full routine service every 4000 miles. New Bridgestone Battleaxe BT21 tyres were fitted 1,000 miles ago. Paintwork and alloy wheels are excellent, given the bike's age. Gear-box is silky-smooth (unusual for a BMW) and the bike rides like a dream with handling and performance comparable with much younger machinery. The bike has standard BMW touring panniers and top box. The BMW top box is tiny so a Givi rack is fitted. Bike has other standard useful equipment ie heated grips and gear indicator and vario screen. The bike comes with the original Owner's Handbook and two sets of keys. It qualifies for Classic Insurance. Good examples of the K Series with low miles are beginning to attract high prices. This bike has been fastidiously maintained and with continued care it will appreciate in value.</description>

        <description>Reluctantly selling my baby due to lack of use, (missus, kids and a dog) looking to raise funds for a camper conversion project. So would like to sell or part exchange for a van. She is quick and runs sweet, MOT till July but has been garages and hardly any miles since last MOT. It's a 16 year old bike so there are a few minor scratches as can be expected but nothing bad, I have a paint pen of a matching colour so can be covered. No sensible offer refused after viewing.</description>
